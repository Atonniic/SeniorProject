Thanks, applied _to my svn repo_ :)

I don't have blead commit bits, but I'll present a new tarball for

Louise,

Knowing that Production Offshore has had various client meetings with Marathon, I asked Kevin Miller to craft this email articulating who he had been dealing with and in what capacity.  Earlier this morning, I spoke with Tammie and she informed me that the Marathon meeting would be with Steve Lowden. Kevin knows that this email is being forwarded to you and that this note is for information purposes only.  Although he is the Producer One product specialist, he does not expect to be at the meeting that you are arranging with Marathon.

Jean,

As you know we have had several meetings with Marathon at various levels to discuss mainly offshore projects.  Our initial meetings were with senior management to discuss deepwater projects and utilization of existing Marathon infrastructure.  David Golder, Sr. VP Commercialization and Development, was the highest level Marathon executive that at we have had discussions.  Most recently, I have contacted Pat Kuntz, VP Natural Gas and Crude Oil Sales, to set up a luncheon and discuss Enron's decision to not pursue deepwater infrastructure transactions and introduce the Producer One product.   This seemed like a reasonable way to introduce the Producer One product and close out the deepwater business with Marathon.  Over the past nine months we have had several meetings and a dinner party over the Christmas Holidays.  If you are going to meet with some of the same Marathon senior management that we have had previous discussions it might be desirable to have Ken or I present for continuity.   

Thanks  ... Kevin

>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on ""who can I work with"" and only
maybe 10% on ""how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?""

You are right.  It was our mistake of executing the wrong  agreement.
 
We will take your 2nd alternative:
 
2. Leave the Inside Ferc. reference for July and change  Aug - Oct. to
enable future hedging opportunities. We would need to create  an
amendment for NGI if you want to go this route.
 
Please make the amendment and sent it to me

Subject: Revised Cover Page to Price  Confirm
I noticed that Mexicana and ENA inadvertantly executed the  confirm that
referenced an ""Inside FERC"" Socal Border Index. I believe that  we had
revised the paperwork to reflect a ""Natural Gas Intelligence""  Socal
Border Price since that is the index used for fianancial settlement  in
the basis markets.  
The Inside FERC index is new (started  in March 2001) and reflects an
index of $4.76 for July whereas NGI  published $4.70. Should you elect to
hedge August, Sept and/or October, we  would need to amend the agreement
to reflect the NGI posting.
Here  are our options:
1. Substitue the first page of the confirm (I would  need to send it back
to you for initials) for July - Oct.
2. Leave the  Inside Ferc. reference for July and change Aug - Oct. to
enable future  hedging opportunities. We would need to create an
amendment for NGI if you  want to go this route.
Please call me to discuss at your earliest  convenience - I will be out
of the office this afternoon but back Monday  morning.
Regards,
Stephanie

Michelle,
 
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.  Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out. 
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.  
 
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.  They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them. 
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.

Subject:	New Iowa Pipeline

Here is some additional information that we picked up regarding the pipeline right-of-way acquisition or discussion activities said to be going on in Iowa and it seems to fit the North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group project.   This is prompting some talk by legislators to try again in the next session of the Iowa Legislature to toughen up Iowa's condemnation laws.   Should this in anyway influence what we contemplating in regard to the Iowa land restoration rules?

--It would not be an oil line
--Prudhoe Bay would be the source of supply
--It could involve a partnership of BP, Phillips and Exxon
--Its route would be to the northeast of Alliance pipeline
--It could be as large as a 50"" line
--Its could be about a $10B project

This seems to fit this project:

AlasCan Group Wins Conceptual
Engineering Work for Alaska Pipeline

DALLAS--(BUSINESS WIRE)--April 23, 2001--The North American Natural Gas Pipeline Group (NANGPG), a consortium of ExxonMobil, BP and Phillips, has awarded a conceptual engineering contract for a multi-billion dollar pipeline that will stretch from Alberta to Chicago, Illinois, to a five-company joint venture called The AlasCan Group. The group includes Kellogg Brown & Root, Colt Engineering Corporation, Natchiq, NANA/Colt Engineering, and Michael Baker Corp. The conceptual engineering work will allow the client to submit regulatory and environmental permits required to the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and Canada's National Energy Board so that the project can proceed.

The approximately 1,800-mile stretch of pipeline, designated the Alberta to Market segment by NANGPG, runs from near Edmonton, Alberta, to Chicago. This pipeline is part of NANGPG's plan to deliver natural gas from Prudhoe Bay to the lower 48 states and is a continuation of the pipeline from Prudhoe Bay to Alberta. The project will consist of a large diameter pipeline with compressor stations and related facilities.

The work will be executed in Colt's offices in Calgary, Canada, with participation of specialists from the five organizations.

I presume you are using the function map() from the maps package.
?map says that it returns a list with x, y, range, and names
components.
You could do something like following, for example (UNTESTED).

  state.borders.ll<-map(""state"",plot=FALSE)
  state.borders<-project(cbind(state.borders.ll$x,state.borders.ll$y),proj=""+proj=lcc +lat_1=48 +lat_2=33 +lon_0=-100"")
  lines(state.borders)

Tom <tomwhore@slack.net>,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,"Fri, 23 Aug 2002 19:01:45 -0400 (EDT)",The GOv gets tough on Net Users.....er Pirates..,"from http://www.arstechnica.com/

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

Subject:



        There were more developments the past few days in the syncoal area

that might interest you.

        As you know, the IRS plans to write the ""capacity"" of each syncoal

plant into any private letters rulings it issues in the future.  Plant

owners will be held to production at this level.

        I spoke to Joe Makurath this morning about a rumor that he plans to

hold one project that is seeking a ruling to a ""capacity"" of 198,000 tons a

year.  Makurath is the IRS branch chief for section 29 rulings.  The ""rumor""

was actually a report by a tax lawyer for Detroit Edison that the IRS looked

at actual output at his client's plant in 1998 and derived the ""capacity"" of

the plant from this output.  The tax lawyer complained, but was told he

could ""lump it.""

        Makurath said the following:

        1. He has made no final decision about how to determine capacity.

        2. The IRS has issued only one ruling since the rulings window

reopened in April.  That was a ruling to someone who already had a ruling,

but who had merely changed the entity that owns the project.  The new ruling

does not specify the capacity of the project.  That's because there was no

change in process from when the earlier ruling was issued.  He regards a

change in feedstock as a change in process.

        3. The ""capacity"" will be the capacity of the facility when it went

into service in June 1998.

        4. He is still feeling his way on how to determine the capacity when

the facility went into service.  Actual output is merely an ""interesting

fact.""  Capacity is not the same thing as output.  Some people made

representations about capacity at the time.  It would be ""strange"" if a

facility that people thought was capable of producing ""100 units in June

1998 is now able to produce 1,000 units.""  That might call into question

whether the facility was in service in June 1998 because it was just

starting to ramp up.  (An old revenue ruling holds that a power plant was in

service when it was producing at 17% of capacity and ramping up steadily

from there.)

        There was another rumor today that the IRS has backed off somewhat

in the Detroit Edison case.  The taxpayer is hoping it can get a capacity of

two times nameplate.  The coalition of syncoal owners is gearing back up to

lobby Congress for help.

Summary: imap-tte

Initial Comment:
A patch that enables train-to-exhaustion support for IMAP.

This patch has three parts:

1. an __init__.py in the scripts folder that makes some of the classes in sb_imapfilter available to tte.py.  This change is not represented in the patch file; you'll have to add __init__.py yourself.

2. Some imap support in mboxutils.py

3. Some refactoring in sb_imapfilter.py to sink the port selection logic into IMAPSession.__init__ so that it can be used by tte.py.  In the process we simplify the uses of IMAPSession considerably.

This is probably not refactored in the best way; in particular, #1 above should probably never happen and whatever is used by both sb_imapfilter.py and tte.py should be moved into spambayes/ or at least out of scripts/.  However, before taking on any major restructuring I wanted to get this into the hands of a spambayes devel who can make sure I'm on the right track.

I'm a little curious about the -C flag.  The code reads:

         elif opt in (""-c"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = arg
         elif opt in (""-C"", ""--cullext""):
             cullext = ''
In general it seems you cleaned up my crappy code in tte.py quite a bit. 
Thanks for that...  A couple comments:

* The ""--cullext"" can't work for both -C and -c.  Maybe you should have
""--cull"" (cull with no extension) to avoid conflict?  I made that change. 
Let me know if you have a different change in mind.

* I don't know the sb_imapfilter code at all.  I'll assign this to Tony in
case he has a moment to scan that part of the patch.  Tony, just mark it
closed if you agree with the changes or can easily change anything you take
issue with.

* You're using psycopg classifier?  Brave man. ;-)

Great!  Please give the code a once-over before checking it in.  It
touches quite a few parts of SpamBayes and I don't want to step on any
toes.

I would like you to try it out a little, at least, before feeling
confident about it.  I've only used it on IMAP folders and I wouldn't want
to break the other use cases.

Dave,

Do you think this has stabilized well enough to apply to the
repository?  If so, I'll just make a quick review and apply
it.

That patch evolved yet again, massively.  I implemented a version of
culling for IMAP and refactored tte.py to greatly simplify it and remove
redundancy.  Hope you find that nice and not annoying ;-)

Subject: RE: Azurix Global Insurance Programme


Sorry for the delayed response, however, I was not in the office last week.

Originally, on moving Azurix back into Enron CRM, it was decided to leave
Azurix on a separate insurance program to retain flexibility for potential
sale activity.  (We did combine them into the Enron Directors and Officers
Liability program as Azurix could no longer carry their own coverage,
following the ownership change.)

We have not considered the options in the event of a sale, should Wessex
and a select few assets not be included.  I understand that the current
liability limit maintained by Azurix is $600,000,000.  The Enron limit is
more than that.  As an Enron subsidiary, low liability limits are not
acceptable and in those cases where ""separate"" programs are purchased,  the
excess amount above the separate program is maintained here.  I am
traveling tomorrow and will return to the office Wednesday before noon.  We
need to meet and discuss.  I will phone you on Wednesday.

   Subject:  Azurix Global Insurance Programme

   John,

   Wessex has to start work around now on next year's budget - one of the
   first
   tasks for me to do is to come up with next years insurance costs.

   I am proposing to cost this on the basis of reverting back to a
   standalone
   insurance programme for Wessex as opposed to being part of the Azurix
   Global
   Insurance Programme.  The main reasons for this are:

   Following the hefty premium rise in 2001 the global programme is now on
   a
   par with a standalone programme with regard premiums but more expensive
   overall due to the much higher excess levels at Azurix.

   Due to the above it could easily be argued that the global programme is
   not
   offering best value for Wessex acting as a standalone company which of
   course it must do under its licence - this causes potential 'RAG 5'
   problems
   with the regulator.

   The levels of coverage previously enjoyed by Wessex prior to the global
   programme had been more than adequate for approximately 10 years.

   If AZX assets are sold this year there may be no need for an Azurix
   programme but to consider absorbing Wessex into any Enron programme will
   probably only add to the problems above given that Wessex and Enron are
   such
   diverse entities in terms of size, activities, locations and therefore
   insurable risk.

   Please could you confirm what I am proposing is OK with Enron.

   Regards.

   Mark Watts

   Treasurer

How many of you would you think need to be involved in a budget review
of Wessex?     I am trying to make the costs be the lowest, but Stan
think's it need's to be face to face.    Typically Stan would like most
of the management team in attendance, but if you and Colin have a
preference let me know and I will attempt to get it planned out.

For reference purposes, Tracy Geaccone is responsible for pulling

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

Jeff is pretty full up with the CA legislature and all the electric stuff.  We can try him, tho.  What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.

leslie, I would like to talk to you and jeff regarding ENA's plans to talking to the PUC regarding hedging activities... let's do this early next week.  Is there a time that is best to schedule.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list).

Scott Norton <nortonsm@yahoo.com>,r-help@stat.math.ethz.ch,"Sun, 08 Apr 2007 19:55:27 -0700",[R] Repeated Measures design using lme,"Hi, 
I have what I believe is a repeated-measures dataset that I'm trying to analyze using lme().  This is *not* homework, but an exercise in my trying to self-teach myself repeated-measure ANOVA for other *real* datasets that I have and that are extremely similar to the following design.

I'm fairly sure the dataset described below would work with lme() -- but it'd be great if anybody can confirm that after I describe the dataset below) 

The study involves measuring the effect of a drug on blood pressure. There were 16 patients in all and 6 replicate measures per patient of their blood pressure on one week (one measure per day). Two weeks later, a drug was introduced to 8 randomly selected patients in such a way that I had equal representation of the 4 age groups among the two treatment groups. Then, another two weeks later, 6 replicate measures per patient (per day) of blood pressure was retaken.  So each patient had 12 total measures whether they were in the treatment group or in the control group (6 reads (R1-R6) in the baseline-week and another 6 reads (R1-R6) in the post-treatment week).  

So, 
Background: 16 patients 
Response measure: Blood pressure 
Fixed Factor: 4 Age groups 
Fixed Factor: Drug vs. NoDrug 
Random factor: Day of the read (i.e. 6 replicate reads (R1-R6) at the baseline time, and 6 replicate reads (R1-R6) after the drug has had time to take effect) 
Random Factor: Subjects 1-16

…            …            …            …    …        …

I'm trying to do an analysis of variance to decide whether there is a measurable change in blood pressure between the Treat and Control groups.

Another issue is that some of the 16 patients didn't get all 6 replicate reads in their pre/post treatment weeks, so I need to include the na.omit function.

What I think I'm having the most trouble with is the repeated reads (R1 through R6) in the pre/post treatment weeks.  I'm fairly sure this is a random variable -- their order or identify (R1 in pre-treatment week has no relation to R1 in the post-treatment week, etc).  By placing Read as a random variable, am I covering myself there?
If I execute:

> summary(lme(BP ~ Group, random = ~ 1 | Patient, data = bloodpress, na.action=na.omit))

I get a result, but I'm not sure it's correct -- do I need to tell the model about the Read factor (R1-R6 in pre/post weeks)?  

I'm really trying to set the right form of the lme() function call to decide 
1) if there is a statistical difference between the Treat/Control groups and,
2) if one takes into account AgeGroup, is there a statistical difference between Treat/Control Groups, and finally
3) if I don't see a statistical difference, can someone recommend an R function that might solve the supplemental question, ""given the noise in day-to-day blood pressure reads, and given that I wanted to have enough statistical power to observe a say, a 5% benefit in blood pressure, how many additional reads or patients I would need.""

Basically, is lme() the proper function, and can someone offer any pointers on what my call to this function should look like to make the above to determinations?

Thanks!
-Scott

I'm searching for an R package that will produce power analyses for

with a pile of negative results (I'm the King, baby).  I found
asypow, which applies to likelihood ratio tests.  However, we
generally have the power to do Wald tests, I just need to prove it so
that we can publish it ;)

If this is a ""dumb"" question (i.e., there's something inherent in
doing the test that implies the power to do detect an effect, or
published results for certain sample sizes), please let me know, it
will save me a lot of time.

It's not possible to know from your description exactly what you're doing,
but perhaps the following will help: 

(1) I presume that your nominal variable is exogenous, since otherwise it
wouldn't be sensible to use 2SLS. 

(2) You don't have to make your own dummy regressors for a nominal variable;
just represent it in the model as a factor as you would, e.g., in lm(). 

(3) Do you have at least as many instrumental variables (including the dummy
regressors) as there are structural coefficients to estimate? If not, the
structural equation is underidentified, which will produce the error that
you've encountered.

I hope this helps,
 John

Firstly I'd like to thank all of you for the fast and very helpful feedback
that I got to my question today.  I have one more question though.  I
downloaded the w3 and url files from the server at the first try thanks to
the help that I received today.  Then though I tried to build them.  I
started by trying the w3 program.  I used the following lines which produced
some strange results.  Would any one be able to set me straight?

./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/src/beta/w3 --exec-prefix=/usr/
local/src/beta/w3 --with-url=/url/url
That worked fine so I moved to the next step.
make
At the bottem of the text I got the following messages:
Cannot open load file: /url/url/url-vars.el
make[1]: *** [custom-load.el] Error 255
make[1]: Leaving directory `/usr/local/src/beta/w3/lisp'
make: *** [w3] Error 2

When I got around to trying the url package I had no problems.  In saying
that this doesn't necessarily mean that I was doing it right so below are
the commands I used.
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so
I'm not completely certain if I've used the right method here.

Thanks again

"""Bi-Info (http://members.home.nl/bi-info)"" <bi-info@home.nl>",Gabor Grothendieck <ggrothendieck@gmail.com>,"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 00:23:08 +0200",Re: [R] Reasons to Use R,"Licensing is a big issue in software. The way I prefer it is an easy 
license, a license which makes it possible that I can work on another 
PC, without paying a lot of money. R produces quite good results and is 
widely used. That makes it a statistical package that I want.
The other thing is that working with large datasets requires ""some"" 
effort by software makers to get it working. I doubt if R has the 
capability of working consistently with large datasets. That is an issue 
I think. I have done some comparisons between SPSS and R, and R seems to 
be performing allright, so I can do computations with it. Nonetheless: 
the data handling is not quite as good I think in comparison with SAS.

When I started doing statistics there were about three packages: SPSS, 
SAS and BMDP (at least: these were available). On a PC you were required 
to use SPSS.
Nowadays there are hundreds, some with excellent database facilities, or 
you can compute the newest statistical tests, or an exotic one. I 
haven't got a clue how to work with new database facilities. dBase was 
my only database education and everything has changed. So I cannot 
answer if R is capable of working with large datasets in relation to 
databases. I really don't know. The only thing I know that if I compute 
a ChiSq, it works on a relatively large dataset (not Fisher tests by the 
way). The same with a likelihood procedure, or tabulations including 
non-parametrics or factor analysis.   But databases are an issue I've 
been told by a guy who works with R. SAS was a better option he told me.

So what's the big deal about S using files instead of memory like R. I 
don't get the point. Isn't there enough swap space for S? (Who cares 
anyway: it works, isn't it?) Or are there any problems with S and large 
datasets? I don't get it. You use them, Greg. So you might discuss that 
issue.

Wilfred










The licences keep changing, some have in the past but don't now, some
you can get an additional licence for home at a discounted price. Some
it depends on the type of licence you have at work (currently our SAS
licence is such that the 3 people in my group can all have it installed,
but at most 1 can be using it at any 1 time, how does that affect
installing/using it at home).  I may be able to install some of the
software at home also, but for most of them I have given up trying to
figure out the legality of it and so I have not installed them at home
to be on the safe side.

Some of the doctors I work with who are also affiliated with the local
university have mentioned that they can get a discounted academic
version of SAS and could use that, but my interpretation of the academic
licence that one showed me (probably not the most recent) said (in my
interpretation, I am not a lawyer) that if they published the results
without paying a licence upgrade fee, they would be violating the
licence (the academic version was intended for teaching only).

The R licence on the other hand is pretty clear that I can install it
and use it pretty much anywhere I want.

You are right in correcting me, R is not the only package that can be
used on multiple computers.  I do think it is the most straight forward
of the good ones.

If I get it right, no RFC (Request For Comments) is needed (or
helpful).

Here is very rough the guideline (no warranty):

The first step is a RFD (Request For Discussion) to the moderated
group news.announce.newgroups with the desired name and charter of the
group. The discussion period takes at least 30 days.

Then it is possible to post a CFV (Call For Votes) again with (a
possibly new) charter and instruction how to cast a vote.  The
voting takes between 21 and 31 days.

Then the results are posted and after a 5 days waiting period 100 or
more YES votes are needed and a 2/3 majority over the NO votes are
neccessary to create the group.

The complete ``How to Create a New Usenet Newsgroup'' is appended.

		 GUIDELINES FOR USENET GROUP CREATION

REQUIREMENTS FOR GROUP CREATION:

   These are guidelines that have been generally agreed upon across
USENET as appropriate for following in the creating of new newsgroups in
the ""standard"" USENET newsgroup hierarchy. They are NOT intended as 
guidelines for setting USENET policy other than group creations, and they
are not intended to apply to ""alternate"" or local news hierarchies. The 
part of the namespace affected is comp, news, sci, misc, soc, talk, rec,
which are the most widely-distributed areas of the USENET hierarchy.
   Any group creation request which follows these guidelines to a
successful result should be honored, and any request which fails to
follow these procedures or to obtain a successful result from doing so
should be dropped, except under extraordinary circumstances.  The
reason these are called guidelines and not absolute rules is that it is
not possible to predict in advance what ""extraordinary circumstances""
are or how they might arise.
   It should be pointed out here that, as always, the decision whether or not
to create a newsgroup on a given machine rests with the administrator of that
machine. These guidelines are intended merely as an aid in making those
decisions.


The Discussion

1) A request for discussion on creation of a new newsgroup should be posted to
   news.announce.newgroups, and also to any other groups or mailing lists at
   all related to the proposed topic if desired.  The group is moderated, and
   the Followup-to: header will be set so that the actual discussion takes
   place only in news.groups.  Users on sites which have difficulty posting to
   moderated groups may mail submissions intended for news.announce.newgroups
   to newgroups@uunet.uu.net.

   The article should be cross-posted among the newsgroups, including
   news.announce.newgroups, rather than posted as separate articles.  Note that
   standard behaviour for posting software is to not present the articles in
   any groups when cross-posted to a moderated group; the moderator will handle
   that for you.

2) The name and charter of the proposed group and whether it will be moderated
   or unmoderated (and if the former, who the moderator(s) will be) should be
   determined during the discussion period. If there is no general agreement on
   these points among the proponents of a new group at the end of 30 days of
   discussion, the discussion should be taken offline (into mail instead of
   news.groups) and the proponents should iron out the details among
   themselves.  Once that is done, a new, more specific proposal may be made,
   going back to step 1) above.  

3) Group advocates seeking help in choosing a name to suit the proposed
   charter, or looking for any other guidance in the creation procedure, can
   send a message to group-advice@uunet.uu.net; a few seasoned news administrators
   are available through this address.

The Vote

Currently, the use of the Usenet Volunteer Votetakers (UVV) is strongly
advocated for all newsgroup proposals.  Ron Dippold <rdippold@qualcomm.com>
co-ordinates this group.  Contact him to arrange the handling of the vote.
The mechanics of vote will be handled in accord with the paragraphs below.

1) AFTER the discussion period, if it has been determined that a new group is
   really desired, a name and charter are agreed upon, and it has been
   determined whether the group will be moderated and if so who will
   moderate it, a call for votes may be posted to news.announce.newgroups and
   any other groups or mailing lists that the original request for discussion
   might have been posted to. There should be minimal delay between the
   end of the discussion period and the issuing of a call for votes.
   The call for votes should include clear instructions for how to cast
   a vote. It must be as clearly explained and as easy to do to cast a
   vote for creation as against it, and vice versa.  It is explicitly
   permitted to set up two separate addresses to mail yes and no votes
   to provided that they are on the same machine, to set up an address
   different than that the article was posted from to mail votes to, or
   to just accept replies to the call for votes article, as long as it
   is clearly and explicitly stated in the call for votes article how
   to cast a vote.  If two addresses are used for a vote, the reply
   address must process and accept both yes and no votes OR reject
   them both.

2) The voting period should last for at least 21 days and no more than 31
   days, no matter what the preliminary results of the vote are. The exact
   date that the voting period will end should be stated in the call for
   votes. Only votes that arrive on the vote-taker's machine prior to this
   date will be counted.

3) A couple of repeats of the call for votes may be posted during the vote, 
   provided that they contain similar clear, unbiased instructions for
   casting a vote as the original, and provided that it is really a repeat
   of the call for votes on the SAME proposal (see #5 below). Partial vote
   results should NOT be included; only a statement of the specific new
   group proposal, that a vote is in progress on it, and how to cast a vote.
   It is permitted to post a ""mass acknowledgement"" in which all the names
   of those from whom votes have been received are posted, as long as no
   indication is made of which way anybody voted until the voting period
   is officially over.

4) ONLY votes MAILED to the vote-taker will count. Votes posted to the net
   for any reason (including inability to get mail to the vote-taker) and 
   proxy votes (such as having a mailing list maintainer claim a vote for 
   each member of the list) will not be counted.

5) Votes may not be transferred to other, similar proposals. A vote shall
   count only for the EXACT proposal that it is a response to. In particular,
   a vote for or against a newsgroup under one name shall NOT be counted as
   a vote for or against a newsgroup with a different name or charter,
   a different moderated/unmoderated status or (if moderated) a different
   moderator or set of moderators.

6) Votes MUST be explicit; they should be of the form ""I vote for the
   group foo.bar as proposed"" or ""I vote against the group foo.bar
   as proposed"". The wording doesn't have to be exact, it just needs to
   be unambiguous. In particular, statements of the form ""I would vote
   for this group if..."" should be considered comments only and not
   counted as votes.

7) A vote should be run only for a single group proposal.  Attempts to create
   multiple groups should be handled by running multiple parallel votes rather
   than one vote to create all of the groups.

The Result

1) At the completion of the voting period, the vote taker must post the
   vote tally and the E-mail addresses and (if available) names of the voters
   received to news.announce.newgroups and any other groups or mailing lists
   to which the original call for votes was posted. The tally should include
   a statement of which way each voter voted so that the results can be
   verified.

2) AFTER the vote result is posted, there will be a 5 day waiting period,
   beginning when the voting results actually appear in 
   news.announce.newgroups, during which the net will have a chance to
   correct any errors in the voter list or the voting procedure.

3) AFTER the waiting period, and if there were no serious objections that might
   invalidate the vote, and if 100 more valid YES/create votes are received
   than NO/don't create AND at least 2/3 of the total number of valid votes
   received are in favor of creation, a newgroup control message may be sent 
   out.  If the 100 vote margin or 2/3 percentage is not met, the group should 
   not be created.

4) The newgroup message will be sent by the news.announce.newgroups moderator
   at the end of the waiting period of a successful vote.  If the new group is
   moderated, the vote-taker should send a message during the waiting period to
   David C. Lawrence <tale@uunet.uu.net> with both the moderator's contact
   address and the group's submission address. 

5) A proposal which has failed under point (3) above should not again be
   brought up for discussion until at least six months have passed from the
   close of the vote.  This limitation does not apply to proposals which never
   went to vote.

Horace,

Hope all is well with you in the Enron transition. I had a short visit with
Mike Rosen at AAPG in Denver.

I am a Trustee with a group in Dallas called ""Institute for the Study of
Earth and Man @ SMU"" or  ISEM (other trustees include Leighton Stewart and
Marlan Downey). We have an annual energy roundtable - this years event is a
2-3 day gathering in Taos, New Mexico, September 21-22 (arrive Thursday
evening, leave on Sunday). Title of conference is ""Opportunities and
Practicalities in the North American Energy Sector - With emphasis on Gas"".

Marlan and I are part of the planning team for the roundtable - we would
like to have an Enron person attend (we limit attendance to 25) to make
short informal presentation about U.S. gas and power, including California
problems, and participate in the discussion.

Can you suggest someone - better yet, forward this email with tentative
agenda (attachment) to an Enron exec who may be interested in attending our
Roundtable. 

Mike

Beautiful.  

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating prejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's prejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs.  

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of performance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never ""accepted"" the meters.  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It was my great pleasure to have partnered with you on this.

Subject:	RE: Northern v. ONEOK

Britt,

We have done a thorough analysis of ONEOK's calculation of pre-judgment interest and are in agreement with their amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).  

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to Northern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars for the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calculation of the accumulated interest.  Since this is a dollar-valued OBA, each month's imbalance was valued at the appropriate monthly index price and a 6% simple interest calculation was applied from that month until the current period.  We had a significant amount of monthly imbalances due Northern early in the review period that carried forward very large credit interest balances due us.  For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG valued at ($753,541.27).  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 997 days (September 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amount due NNG of ($123,498.19).  For comparison purposes, contrasting with this month is a large debit imbalance due ONEOK of $769,407.44 for the month of December 2000.  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 113 days (February 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amount due ONEOK of $14,292.01.  By summarizing these two months, we have an imbalance value that is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net interest valuation due Northern of ($109,206.18).  This scenario plays out for the entire review period netting to a cumulative credit amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).

If you would like to review the calculations in detail, please let me know and I will forward the spreadsheet to you.

Rick, Harry & Tangie

	Harry,

	We need your help yet one more time.  Tomorrow morning I will have hand-delivered to you a letter from Ben Singletary, ONEOK's attorney, stating that they calculate pre-judgment interest (using Northern's methodology, which the arbitrators specifically approved--thanks again to you, Tangi and Rick!) such that ONEOK actually owes Northern about $50,000.  We certainly don't mind them owing us $50,000; however, we want to see if ONEOK owes us even more than that.  

	If you need additional information (such as the actual panel award), please call Becky Zikes and she will make sure a copy gets to you.  I will be out from about 9:30 to 3:00 tomorrow, but will be in later in the day.

	Many thanks.

""I'd love to be six again,"" she replied. 

On the morning of her birthday, he got her up bright and early and off 
they went to a local theme park.  What a day!  He put her on every 
ride in the park:  the Death Slide, the Screaming Loop, the Wall of Fear- 
everything there was!  Wow!  Five hours later she staggered out of the 
theme park, her head reeling and her stomach upside down.   Right to a 
McDonald's they went, where he husband ordered a Big Mac for her along 
with extra fries and refreshing chocolate shake.  Then it was off to a 
movie - the latest Star Wars! 

What a fabulous adventure!  Finally she wobbled home with her husband 
and collapsed into bed. 

He leaned over and lovingly asked, ""Well, dear; what was it like being 
six again?"" 

One eye opened, ""You idiot, I meant my dress size."" 

The moral of this story is:  If a woman speaks and a man is there to 
hear her, he will get it wrong anyway.

They're not in the master archive. I guess it's because they're not
worth the effort, since these images are much smaller than a full size CD.

hmm.  This still seems to be a test list, which SURBL don't want to see

we'd better leave it out until he wants to see it in.

Hash: SHA1

==============================================================
                                      Port 80 is the new HTTP.
                             -- Jeremy Allison on Web Services
==============================================================
Release Announcements
=====================
This is the first release candidate of the Samba 3.0.25 code
base and is provided for testing only.  An RC release means
that we are close to the final release but the code may still
have a few remaining minor bugs.  This release is *not* intended
for production servers.  There has been a substantial amount
of development since the 3.0.23/3.0.24 series of stable releases.
We would like to ask the Samba community for help in testing
these changes as we work towards the next significant production
upgrade Samba 3.0 release.

Major features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:

  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.
  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join'
    process.
  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and
    per domain backends.
  o New plug-in interface for the ""winbind nss info"" parameter.
  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of
    inotify on Linux.
  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS
    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side
    by side on the Same server.
  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including
    improved read performance with Linux servers.
  o Man pages for VFS plug-ins.


Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
===================================

Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating
domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
information.


New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
================================

The 3.0.25 release of Samba will include a rewritten IdMap interface
for winbindd which replaces the ""idmap backend"" parameter.  The
initial design document may be found at

	http://www.samba.org/~idra/samba3_newidmap.pdf

Please refer to the ""idmap domains"" description in the smb.conf(5)
man page for more details.


Dynamic DNS Updates
===================

The ""net ads join"" command is now able to register the host's DNS
A records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This
feature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate
when running the ./configure script.  There is also a related ""net
ads dns"" command for refreshing a host's records which could be
launched from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.


Support for Additional ACL Modules
==================================

Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer
which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations
on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.


VFS ReadAhead Plugin
====================

Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved
performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between
Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
module by adding the following lines to the share definition
in smb.conf:

[file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.

Your vote on Crop Idol 
By OLIVER HARVEY

WELCOME to Crop Idol  your chance to choose Britain's most out-of-this-wor=
ld corn circle. 


The intricate patterns, which some say are the work of aliens, are big news=
 again thanks to the spooky new Mel Gibson film Signs.


Nine of the best are shown on the right. You can vote for your favourite by=
 clicking on the image and dialling the number shown beneath.

Calls cost only 10p, or 12 cents from the Republic of Ireland (though it ma=
y be a bit more if you contact us from other planets).

Lines close at 6pm today. We will reveal the
winner tomorrow.


Aliens ... or hoaxers?
THE debate continues to rage over the origin of crop circles.

Many believe they are simply the work of human hoaxers  while others are c=
onvinced they are made by aliens trying to communicate with us.

Crop circle enthusiasts insist that some of the designs appear so quickly a=
nd on such a vast scale that it is impossible for humans to have made them. =


Witnesses even claim to have seen balls of light moving through the fields =
on the nights that circles appear.

Researchers have found connections between some patterns and symbols from a=
ncient religions, mathematics and even music. 

Crop circles were first spotted in Britain in the early 1970s and now appea=
r throughout the world. The weird outlines are still most common in the sout=
h of England.

Theories about their cause include whirlwinds  known to circle experts as =
plasma vortexes  earth energies from ley lines or even forces from the huma=
n mind.

In the past the circles have also been blamed on mating roe deer, hedgehogs=
, helicopters and holes in the ozone layer.

Raymond Cox, Chairman of the Centre for Crop Circle Studies, said last nigh=
t: ""It's a great unsolved mystery.

""We know not all crop circles are created by humans but we cannot say for s=
ure what is making them.""

Plus lots of photos

in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service

in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

It shouldbe there by default. If not, modprobe it in for the backspace
beeps.

Don't mess with the mkinitrd script. If you want a script, write your
own that passes arguments.

Gack. Did you try 7.3 with the compat-glibc first? Or does it require an
antique kernel?

Man admits Soham kidnapping hoax calls

A man has admitted making hoax calls to police investigating the
disappearance of Soham schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells.
Wrexham Magistrates Court, in North Wales, heard jobless Howard Youde made
three calls to police in Cambridgeshire claiming to have abducted the
youngsters.
He was arrested in Wrexham in the early hours of August 16 when officers
traced the call to a phone box on the town's Brook Street.
The 45-year-old, of Queensway, Hope, near Wrexham, has pleaded guilty to one
count of wasting police time on August 15 this year.
The court was told Youde claimed to have no recollection of making the calls
having been drinking all day.
Defence lawyer Mark Arden says the offence was neither premeditated nor
calculated but added that this was no excuse.
He said: ""What he's done is horrific. It's unforgivable. The distress he's
caused the families is unacceptable.""
Youde has been released on unconditional bail until November 7 when he will
be sentenced.
The hearing has been adjourned for pre-sentence reports although the
defendant has been warned custody is an option.

                               stiffening sinews

         More hot summer days in the mailinglist alleyways,
         dangerously empty of sane postings, strewn with the rotting
         carcasses of broiling vacation messages. Hacktress and
         Silicon Valley's chief rat-keeper LILE ELAM, excitedly posts
         about a new open 802.11 network she's found. ""I am here at
         the police station waiting to see a judge and I thought I
         would check to see if there is connectivity"", she writes,
         somewhat recklessly, to the Bay Area Wireless list. Exit
         the rest of the Wifi community through the nearest window
         and out into the streets... where, cooling tempers, the
         Microsoft Palladium boys are on an endless summer tour,
         reassuring the experts that while, hmm, they *suppose* Pd
         could *theoretically* be used as a Hollywood DRM system,
         they truly have no plans to do any such thing. Cypherpunk
         and friend of freedom Lucky Green hears this; thinks up four
         or five of the obvious Palladium DRM implementations; sends
         them off to be patented in his name. Licensing funds, we
         imagine, will go on cracking his own DRMs. And so the mail
         loops on.

         FOR COPYRIGHT conference, organised by the irrepressible

         fun from the creators of the Scrambling for Safety crypto

         fighting off the audience with a broken chairleg, and other
         epiphenomena of the interzone between legal minds and hacker
         ethics. Oh, and FIPR are still looking for a Programme
         Director, so if you're interested, let them know. We
         suggested a convention raffle (first prize: the director's
         job, second prize: Ross Anderson as your personal slave for
         a day). They say there's some rule that would break, though.

         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without 
         thinking of Martian fighting machines and their ""deafening 
         howls... which roared like thunder"", we're sorry to report 
         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to ""health and safety 
         issues"". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking 
         ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, ""slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them...""

          Occasionally one will get a bit too close to the OS, and

          For dogged WS_FTP users, though, it's got multiple

Brazilian bees keep their own 'insect ranch'

Scientists have found a new species of bee that behaves like a farmer by
keeping herds of insects.
The Amazonian Schwarzula use their own 'insect ranches' to provide food and
building materials.
The bees nest in holes in trees alongside 200 aphid-like insects from a
species called cryptostigma.
Cryptostigma feed on tree sap and excrete a sugar solution, which the bees
stop them from drowning in, by licking it up and turning it into honey.
The insects also produce wax from glands on their backs, which the bees
scrape off and use for their nest.
Nature reports it is the first time farming behaviour has been discovered in
bees.
Biologist Joao Camargo, of the University of Sao Paulo in Brazil, said: ""In
turn the bees provide the insects with sanitary benefits and protection.""
Writing in the journal Biotropica, Camargo says the bees might even carry
their insect ranches around the forest with them and is planning further
research on how they tend to their herd.
Studies of the Schwarzula showed the bees seemed to get most of their sugar
from the insect farms. Some bees were seen licking human sweat for salt.

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic?  I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

  * this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
    do this in Python.
  * this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
    something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
    breakage.  A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag.  I
    propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

Does MoveFileEx solve the atomicity problem that Guido raised in that thread?  I
don't think it does, so I think the situation is still the same.

jeffl@heart.cor.epa.gov,Multiple recipients of list <wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu>,"Thu, 15 Dec 1994 12:35:23 -0600",Introduction,"reetings!

I've recently joined the list so, as Ted Zobeck suggested, I'm sending
this intoduction.

My main interest is soil erosion (wind, water) as affected by global
climate change. Up to now, my approach has been to run a site model (EPIC)
for 100 years at each of 100 sites in a region such as the US cornbelt, and
 to use a statistical framework to get regional means. I plan to move more
toward a spatially explicit (GIS) approach, mainly because I'd like to know
where the eroded soil goes, and how fast. This is part of a latger GIS
oriented project at this lab which is starting to focus on the Columbia
River Basin in the northwestern US. This involves steep, forested land as
well as rangelands and agricultural lands.

I'd be particularly interested in hearing from people (modellers,
experimentors) who are researching erosion and climate change; erosion on
steep or forested lands; or spatially explicit/GIS approaches to modelling
erosion.

Thanks for the reply. It would be my expectation that Enron will pay but
I will look into this and get back to you. What do you think the cost
will be.

Good morning Barry,

I'd be happy to provide you with assistance in this regard.  Will Enron
be
paying for this service?

Please let me know when it would be convenient for you to meet (I am
assuming this will be over the phone).

Best regards,

Judy, you were assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be. I very much  require some
assistance regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

I think the problem comes from the 'adobe' part of the font names - I 
'solved' the problem by installing the newses Ubuntu 7.04 beta and now R 
reports the same font names without 'adobe'.

PPPoE, if you want torun it in routed IP mode. If you are using it as a
bridge, it'll probably work, but you'd be left leaving the computer on,
which would defeat the purpose of getting a router.

The best router I've come accross is the Zyxel 643. Eircom supply this,
but if you have alook online you can probably find it cheaper to buy
online from America or the UK.

Hope this is useful,

Had some trouble deploying dkim-milter-2.4.4 on postfix-2.4.6 (debian etch backports - tried etch 2.3.8 and had the same troubles) and mailman_2.1.9-7.

DKIM-milter is deployed and signing and verifing mode with its primary intent to sign emails on lists.cacert.org mailing lists.

Feb  7 09:27:09 lists postfix/master[22912]: daemon started -- version 2.4.6, configuration /etc/postfix
I deployed it as a typical and sole milter
smtpd_milters = unix:extern-milter/dkim-filter.sock
non_smtpd_milters = $smtpd_milters

Testing on a tiny email list and the email came through signed by dkim.

Feb  7 10:28:29
an email when through to a larger email list poptem-kkrrvq@lists.cacert.org without any error

after a significant number of hours without a peep out of dkim-filter I start to get.

Feb  7 14:40:05 lists postfix/cleanup[15075]: F13C6108238: message-id=<95690946646473.5e95gt09s6@hlin.cacert.org>

These occured for these same to email recipients, every 15 minutes from until Feb  7 21:00:15 when I woke up in a haze. noticed it was failing and turned it off.
The dkim-milter still seems to be running happliy on its unix socket.

This is also noted on 
http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=476123D1.5000602%40hetnet.nl
(the second error). I still can't get a total grasp of whats happing though.

Any tips on how to isolate this error would be really welcome as I really don't want to be trialing on a live system too much.

Mailman ;-)

Trust me, you do *not* want to running your own mailing lists
on your own software.

You'll wind up crying in a dark room looking for something
high-voltage to stick your fingers into.

I have attached the following:

1 file showing our current range of payment arrangements - this is as shown
in the Charges Scheme
2 a copy of our code of practice on debt recovery - pages 4 and 5 give
detail on timescales for chasing debt and how we go about it.  It does also
give some detail on payment options.

Is this ok or is it too detailed?

Not strange at all if ""."" precedes the disconnect. In that

Reading your thoughts and thinking this over, my current impression is that this could make a good wiki page or other tutorial.  Yes there are probably more people out there who would like to do this, but have not had the theory class to learn the details of how this method works.  But rather than give a function that hides the details, I would rather spell out the method (with some explanation) for them to follow, along with what checks need to be done along the way.

For example, this method only works if the desired correlation matrix is positive definite (one way to check this is that all the eigen values are positive), or a modification of this method can still work if it is positive semi-definite.  For the example correlations that started this thread, it worked out that inserting 0 for the non-specified correlations worked, but if the correlations had been enough higher, then 0 would not have worked (can you imagine a case where x1 is highly positively correlated with x2 and x3, but x2 and x3 are independent of each other?)  A tutorial page can explain the test to do and what to do if it fails, a function would tend to hide this important detail and send target users to the mailing list with questions about cryptic error messages.

I am happy to work on a tutorial page, and currently the wiki seems a logical place to put it.  I however have never wikied before (is that the proper verb :-), is there anyone out there who would be willing to help with that side of things?  Or propose a better alternative?

***********************************************************************

FUNDAMENTALS AND REGULATIONS CHANGE WESTERN ENERGY OUTLOOKS

Western energy markets are heading into summer with shifts in the fundamental
and regulatory environment. New forces will reduce pressures on prices and
reliability as the power peak builds.

*  The June 19 FERC Order represents a strong dampener of power prices.

*  Energy demand is off considerably on a year-over-year basis.

*  Lower energy demand has contributed to an easing in natural gas prices in
California, but higher summer loads will likely bring higher gas prices.

John Tatarko <jt@weru.ksu.edu>,Multiple recipients of list <wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu>,"Wed, 11 Jan 1995 13:56:27 -0600",Introduction,"Hello,

I have been 'lurking' on the list for a while and thought it was about 
time I introduce myself.

My name is John Tatarko.  I am with the USDA-ARS Wind Erosion Research 
Unit (sometimes known as The Wind Erosion Lab) in Manhattan, Kansas.

The Wind Erosion Research Unit is now participating in the development 
of a Wind Erosion Prediction System (WEPS) which is a process based 
replacement for the Wind Erosion Equation.  As a member of the WEPS 
development team, I am in charge of the MAIN supervisory program of WEPS.  
The function of the MAIN program is to initialize the model, make calls 
to the submodels, and produce general outputs.  Another of my tasks is 
the testing and application of WEPS for croplands.  Last but not least, I 
am also involved in the development of the wind database and generator 
for WEPS.

Other research interests of mine include soil spatial variability, 
rangeland wind erosion, and GIS applications to wind erosion problems.  I 
will be more than happy to discuss any of the above topics with those 
wishing to do so.

I do not have any questions for the group but would like to take this 
opportunity to announce our World Wide Web and FTP sites.  We hope that 
these sites will allow for better information exchange and promote 
interest in wind erosion research.

The Web site contains, among other things, a short description of our 
Unit, staff, and research mission.  The site also contains a fairly 
extensive (and growing) digital photo archive of wind erosion and related 
photographs which can be viewed or downloaded.  There are also links to 
our FTP site and other related Web sites.  This site is under construction 
and hopefully will continue to grow.

The URL for this WWW site is:

         http://zingg.weru.ksu.edu/


The FTP site is envisioned to be our main venue for the distribution of 
the WEPS model after the initial release this summer.  It is also a source 
of some of the above materials for those without Web access.  Currently the 
FTP site contains the entire digital photo archive, lists of Unit 
publications, as well as a few programs such as a pin meter roughness 
program and a aggregate size distribution analysis program.

The FTP address is:

         ftp.weru.ksu.edu

If you have any questions regarding either of these sites please feel free 
to contact me.

is 10th level, has a 17 CON, a girdle of fire giant strength, a normal dagger

   You can disbatch a helpless opponent in one round.  If he's not resisting
himself ;->, he can cut himself to ribbons in one minute/round.

   By the by, on any of my boards, the bar staff would likely get a touch
upset with this, they'd toss the body out of sight. In the 100 minutes ( -10hp
to 1hp at a rate of one hit point per 10 minute round ) it would take him to
regain conscinous (<-possible spelling error alert), the local theif/theives
would likely find him and steal all his pretty jewelry/coin/stuff.  If it
happened in the first ten minutes, he'd stay DEAD.

  If its a vampiric ring, since you only get back HALF of the hit points you
inflict, he'd die in one round, AND STAY DEAD.

Concievably this fighter could go on for a long time...after all you 
don't HAVE to use all of your strength to cut yourself.  So if we ignore 
strength bonuses, a dagger has an average damage of 2.5 HP/round, and the 
ring can regenerate (hmm, forget is it 1 or 3 HP/round?).  Anyway, you 
get the idea...of course if stupid accidentally pierces himself through 
the heart, diaphragm, throat, etc we're talking dead fighter.

One. Stabs his dagger into his throat and is probably dead or dying. Stabbing
the dagger into his heart would work as well (especially with that girdle).
No, no rules for it, that I could quote -- just common sense...

> What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

I still believe that the massive damage by a direct strike to neck, throat,
heart or something other vital would be more than enough to kill him 
(the ring just does not regenerate enough hitpoints).

Setting aside that fact that self-mutilation is probably a poor way to
impress women, I would rule it as follows:

Since hit points are are not taken to represent the sheer physical
capacity to take damage (it would be absurd that a human of *any* level
could take as much raw damage as a dragon), I treat the hit points
possessed at first level as the raw damage potential of characters.  Now,
although it is possible to give a mortal stroke to an unresisting
opponent, your fighter presumably does not intend to give himself
a mortal wound, but to show off his raw damage potential.  Hence,
figure damage as normal, but take it out of the hit points he had at
first level--you could figure it as doing maximum damage, but then it
wouldn't have the randomness which makes it, like Russian roulette,
a test of courage.  ""Let's see . . . I have 10 hit points left, +7 to
damage, and a dagger which does 1-4 . . . ."" 

In essence, if the character wants to show off, let him show off, but not
without _real_ risk.  Then you'll see how brave he *really* is (or how
stupid, whichever).

>What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

Well, vampires can't suck blood from themselves . . . I'd rule that a 
VRofR doesn't work with respect to self-inflicted wounds.

      Well, if the referee handled the matter of the fighter killing 
himself as a 'helpless opponent', then he could kill himself in 1 melee 
round.  Seeing that he was dead, I'd be highly surprised if the locals 
didn't then wander over -- removing the regen ring (when they saw he was 
healing) -- and loot his body.  :)

Using his full strength, once.  After 1 full attack he would be dead or dying.
You see AD&D claims that hit points aren't a measure of how much damage you
can sustain, but how much damage you can successfully AVOID.  It claimed that
people only have ABOUT 4 actual hit points and the rest are skill in avoidance,
deity favor, etc.  For this same reason you can KILL a sleeping person in ONE
blow, no damage need be rolled they are automatically dead.  It says that you
can kill one person a round in this manner.  So since the fighter is not 
avoiding the blow, one hit will make him dying or dead (use the damage roll
since natural instincts might prevent the AUTOMATIC kill from happening, but
don't give full hit points since he is not avoiding it (give him the standard
3-5)).

As always any opinions I may have written above are mine and mine alone.

Dave.

If I was a lady, I wouldn't be too impressed... ;-)

Heh... does he have to roll to hit?  ...and what if he misses, what will 
the ladies think?  :)

I'd like to say 1st that this wouldn't impress anyone (except at how stupid it
looks)

He can't.  A ring of regeneration will bring one back from the ""dead"" unless 
it was fire or acid damage that caused the wounds.  Not to mention (assuming
you're using the -10 rule) that the best he could hope to do is go unconcious
anyway.

>
>What if it were a vampiric ring of regeneration (we don't know if it is...)

Personally, I don't think that a ring of this type would work at all in the 
situation specified, so you can treat it as if he was wearing no regen
stuff at all.  (rough calculation says about 7 rounds)

You know, I almost want to know why...but...not really.

You mentioned that price is not at issue, but there are other costs than
money that you may want to look at.  On my work machine I have R,
S-PLUS, SAS, SPSS, and a couple of other stats programs; on my laptop
and home computers I have R installed.  So, if a deadline is looming and
I am working on a project mainly in R, it is easy to work on it on the
bus or at home (or in a boring meeting), the same does not work for a
SAS or SPSS project (Hmm, thinking about this now, maybe I need to do
less in R :-).

R and S-PLUS are very flexible/customizable, if you have a certain plot
that you make often you can write your own function/script to do it
automatically, most other programs will give you their standard, then
you have to modify it to meet your specifications.  With sweave (and the
odf and html extensions) you can automate whole reports, very useful for
things that you do month after month.

And what I think is the biggest advantage of R and S-PLUS is that they
strongly encourage you to think about your data.  Other programs (at
least that I am familiar with) tend to have 1 specific way of treating
your data, and expect you to modify your data to fit that programs
model.  These models can be overrestrictive (force you to restructure
your data to fit their model) or underrestrictive (allow things that
should really be separate data objects to be combined into a single
""dataset"") and sometimes both.  S on the other hand allows many
different ways to store and work with your data, and as you analyze the
data, different branches of new analysis open up depending on early
results rather than just getting stock output for a procedure.  If all
you want is a black box where data goes in one end and a specific answer
comes out the other, then most programs will work; but if you want to
really understand what your data has to tell you, then R/S-PLUS makes
this easy and natural.

Hope this helps,

I recently formatted my hp pavillion(s7720.uk) in order to reinstall xp on
it. (Vista was driving me round the bend).
I'm not sure my machine was intended to run anything other than vista. Now
that I've installed xp on it I am missing certain drivers. \\most importantly
\\i cannot connect it to the internet which means I cannot easily search for
drivers.

at present I'm missing drivers for -
Other PCI Bridge Device
PCI Device
SM Bus Controller
Video Controller

What I'm hoping for is that one of you is a hp expert and could help me sort
this out. I'm used to Dell machines so this is proving to be a royal pain in
the $%^ at the moment. To top it off the only other machine in the house is
my italian flatmates spyware ridden piece of shit, wich means saving my own
machine is further complicated.

all help appreciated!

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Had an old Dell Dimension XPS sitting in the corner and decided to
put it to use, I know it was working pre being stuck in the
corner, but when I plugged it in, hit the power nothing happened.
I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell
specific one, ATX block with what looks like one of the old AT
power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want
to install Linux on it when I get it working. If anyone knows
what the problem might be give me a shout.

Cheers,
Peter.

Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

From: 	Enron Announcements/Corp/Enron
Sent:	Sunday, July 08, 2001 5:31 PM
To:	All Enron Worldwide@ENRON
Subject:	HR Organizational Changes


In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

�	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

�	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

�	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

�	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

�	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

�	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

NLRB AGAIN RULES AGAINST LEE LUMBER BUT DECLINES BARGAINING
ORDER

Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp. illegally withdrew
recognition of an incumbent union before a reasonable time
for bargaining had passed, the National Labor Relations
Board rules in its third decision in the longrunning case,
but this time the board declines to impose an affirmative
bargaining order (""Lee Lumber and Building Material Corp.,
""334 N.L.R.B. No. 62, 6/28/01). On remand from the D.C.
Circuit, the board decides 4-0 ""that when an employer has
unlawfully refused to recognize or bargain with an incumbent
union, a reasonable time for bargaining before the union's
majority status can be challenged will be no less than six
months, but no more than one year.""

The board says the length of time that would be reasonable
depends on an analysis of several factors--whether the
parties are bargaining for an initial agreement, the
complexity of the issues being negotiated and the parties'
bargaining procedures, the amount of time spent bargaining
and the number of bargaining sessions, the amount of
progress made in negotiations and how near the parties are
to agreement, and the presence or absence of a bargaining
impasse. Applying these factors, the board decides Lee
Lumber did not bargain for a reasonable time before
withdrawing recognition from United Brotherhood of
Carpenters and Joiners Local 1027. . . . Page AA-1,  Text

FULL SEVENTH CIRCUIT SAYS BARGAINING PACT IRRELEVANT TO
LIABILITY

The full Seventh Circuit rules 6-3 to affirm a district
court's decision that evidence regarding an employer's
duties under a collective bargaining agreement was
inadmissible to prove that the company reacted reasonably in
failing to respond promptly to the misdeeds of a ""serial
harasser"" (""EEOC v. Indiana Bell Tel. Co. Inc. d/b/a
Ameritech Indiana,  ""7th Cir. (en banc), No. 99-1155,
6/27/01).

Judge Easterbrook, in a portion of the ruling joined by four
of the judges, rejects Ameritech Indiana's argument that the
evidence is relevant to the issue of liability in sexual
harassment cases brought under Title VII of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and affirms $15,000 in compensatory damages to
three female Ameritech workers. However on a second issue,
Easterbrook, joined by a different line up of five judges,
reverses a $635,000 award in punitive damages against
Ameritech, finding that evidence regarding arbitration and
the collective bargaining agreement was admissible as to the
issue of punitive damages.

Judge Flaum dissents in part, criticizing the majority's
""sweeping dictate"" that bargaining agreements are
inadmissible in Title VII cases on the issue of liability.
Judge Rovner dissents on the issue of punitive damages,
arguing that the trial court's refusal to admit the evidence
was harmless  error.  . . . Page A-10,  Text E-7

 JUSTICES WILL REVIEW ERISA PREEMPTION OF EXTERNAL REVIEW IN
HEALTH CARE

Amid heated debate in Congress over a patients' bill of
rights, the Supreme Court decides to rule next term on
whether the Employee Retirement Income Security Act preempts
statutes adopted in at least 37 states requiring external,
independent review of managed care organizations' medical
necessity decisions (""Rush Prudential HMO Inc. v. Moran,
""U.S., No. 00-1021, ""cert. granted"" 6/29/01).

The high court will review whether Illinois' external review
law is preempted by ERISA or whether it is ""saved"" from
ERISA preemption because it regulates insurance, an area
traditionally reserved for the states. The case arose after
Eileen Moran tried to recover $94,841 in surgical costs she
had paid after they were denied by Rush Prudential.

In adding the dispute to its 2001-2002 docket, the Supreme
Court opts to rule in a case the Justice Department, in an
amicus brief, had urged the justices not to accept, on
grounds that external review currently is being debated in
Congress.  . . . Page B-1

BNA SURVEY NETS PREDICTIONS OF MODEST ECONOMIC REBOUND

The sharp downturn in the nation's economy during the first
half of 2001 is still not showing any signs of improvement,
yet most economists and policymakers remain confident that
growth will accelerate by the end of the year, according to
BNA's mid-year economic outlook survey.

Among the 24 economists participating in the survey, all but
one believe that growth will rebound by the end of the year
to exceed the first quarter's anemic growth rate of 1.2
percent . Prior to the fourth quarter, however, three of
those economists fully expect to see data showing that the
country had slipped into a mild recession during the second
and third quarters. . . . Page D-1

NO NEW TALKS SCHEDULED IN IBEW DISPUTE WITH CHICAGO ELECTRIC
UTILITY

Two days into a strike by Local 15 of the International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Chicago-based Midwest
Generation Co. has ""no timetable"" for resuming negotiations
over a new contract covering 1,150 of the electric utility's
employees, a company spokesman says. The strike is ""not
about money,"" he says, but rather language that the union
was attempting to insert in the contract that would restrict
the company's use of outside contractors for work beyond the
scope of normal power plant operations.

Maintaining that the company is misrepresenting its position
in the dispute, Local 15 says no contract language has been
proposed to impede or limit the use of outside contractors.
Midwest Generation, it insists, is refusing to bargain in
good faith. While, the company attributes the strike to a
""union failing to recognize that it no longer works in a
utility environment, but in a competitive marketplace."" . .

SUPREME COURT LETS STAND NATIONWIDE ORDER AGAINST BEVERLY
ENTERPRISES

The U.S. Supreme Court lets stand a corporatewide remedial
order imposed by the National Labor Relations Board against
nursing home operator Beverly Enterprises for its widespread
pattern of unfair labor practices (""Beverly Cal. Corp. v.
NLRB, ""U.S., No. 00-1563, ""cert. denied"" 6/29/01). The
Supreme Court denies Beverly's request for review of a
Seventh Circuit ruling substantially upholding the board
decision. The board found the company committed more than
100 unfair labor practices involving 26 nursing homes
nationwide.

The board first issued a corporatewide cease-and-desist
order against Beverly in 1993, but the Second Circuit
overturned it, finding the evidence insufficient for such a
broad remedy. However, the Seventh Circuit in 2000 found
mounting evidence that Beverly ""continues to violate the law
with regularity."" The board was ""entitled to conclude,
especially after specific remedies in [the Second Circuit
case] did not appear to stop the efforts from the company's
central management to stop unions in any way possible, that
the time was past for piecemeal relief,"" the Seventh Circuit
said. . . . Page B-2,  Text E-1

Congress Daily story on House plan for IP in FTAs

[snip]

     Democrats are proposing that the five-year period of exclusivity
for trading partners be allowed to run concurrently with the exclusivity

period in the United States, so that generic availability in the other
country is not delayed beyond the U.S. period.

     That demand is significantly less than some House Democrats and
health activists would have asked, who have sought that any specific
minimum period for data exclusivity be removed from trade agreements.

          Drug Companies Look To Head Off House Dem/Bush Deal

     Pharmaceutical companies are working to head off a deal between
House Democrats and the Bush administration that would weaken
intellectual property protections that affect drug sales overseas.

     The issue of intellectual property rights and access to medicines
is one of six broad areas Democrats are seeking to renegotiate in
agreements with Peru and Colombia, and create a new standard for other
trade agreements going forward.

     The call by House Ways and Means Chairman Rangel to alter IPR
provisions has already generated some pushback from within the
Democratic Caucus, in particular from New Democrats concerned that an
agreement not undercut the drug industry's ability to bring innovative
drugs to the market.

     In separate interviews, Reps. Adam Smith, D-Wash., and James Moran,

D-Va., identified the issue of access to medicines as one part of the
Democratic proposal that might need to be fine-tuned.

     Brand-name pharmaceutical firms met Thursday with staff for New
Democrats and lodged their concerns with the Rangel agenda, according to

a senior New Democrat staffer.

     The staffer stressed that New Democrats support the broad outline
that Rangel offered this week, while details still have to be
negotiated.

     Rangel and Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee Chairman Sander Levin,

D-Mich., laid out their proposal Tuesday to the House Democratic Caucus,

which they hoped would serve as a blueprint for passing free trade deals

and extending presidential trade negotiating authority.

     According to a statement from New Democrats, ""The leadership of the

New Democrat coalition supports the trade principles outlined by
Chairman Rangel and applauds his effort to negotiate a bipartisan
compromise that would allow forward-thinking trade policies to move
ahead.""

     But the inclusion of language opposed by the pharmaceutical
industry is likely to have a heavier impact on the Republican side,
where votes for any eventual trade deals will be every bit as crucial as

Democratic votes.

     Industry lobbyists also raised the issue of intellectual property
protections at a meeting hosted by House Minority Whip Blunt and Chief
Deputy Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., according to a source who
attended the meeting.

     The pharmaceutical issue is not as high-profile as Democratic
demands on labor, and might ultimately be easier to solve, according to
sources close to discussions.

     The labor issue remains intractable because Democrats have not
altered their demand that trade agreements obligate all parties to abide

by core International Labor Organization standards, and neither the Bush

administration nor Republicans are likely to agree to any plan that
would subject the United States to legal challenge over whether its
labor laws conform to the ILO.

     ""Without a safe harbor for U.S. labor law, it's a non-starter,""
Rep. Kevin Brady, R-Texas, a member of the Ways and Means panel, said
Thursday.

     The intellectual property provisions in question affect how quickly

generic drug-makers are able to bring generic versions of patented drugs

to market in developing countries.

     According to sources familiar with the proposals, which are not yet

public, House Democrats are seeking more flexibility in a requirement
that protects clinical test data for brand-named drugs from being used
to bring generic drugs to market for five years after the patented drug
has been registered in a country.

     Critics have charged that the five-year requirement effectively
could delay approval of generics past patent expiration.

     Brand-name manufacturers typically will register a new drug in the
United States and European Union first, which starts a period of test
data exclusivity in those markets. Registration in smaller markets might

not come for months or years.

     That sets up a situation where generic drugs are already available
in the United States, but not in poorer countries because the five-year
data exclusivity provision has not yet expired.

     Democrats are proposing that the five-year period of exclusivity
for trading partners be allowed to run concurrently with the exclusivity

period in the United States, so that generic availability in the other
country is not delayed beyond the U.S. period.

     That demand is significantly less than some House Democrats and
health activists would have asked, who have sought that any specific
minimum period for data exclusivity be removed from trade agreements.

     One industry observer said in some cases data protection is at
least as important as patent protection, because patent infringements
must be challenged in courts that might be corrupt or unsympathetic to
the industry's arguments.

     It is unclear how willing the Bush administration might be to
accept Democratic terms in the area of medicines.

     The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has criticized
countries such as Israel and Chile, in its annual Special 301 report on
intellectual property, for domestic laws aimed at limiting drug
companies' flexibility to take advantage of data exclusivity
protections.

     But several sources in the business community said they doubted the

administration would let the drug industry's concerns stand in the way
of an agreement that will pave the way for large parts of its trade
agenda to move forward.

Subject:	Status report regarding subpenas

This summarizes the status of our work in response to the subpoenas served
on Enron Corp by Dunn's committee and on EES by the AG.

	Today's meeting with Dave Parquet: Amanda Smith and I met with Dave
Parquet at the Enron Corp offices in San Francisco late this afternoon and
then talked with him this evening. He generally described the documents in
the office. He describes most as confidential or proprietary. He will
assemble the team leaders in the office and meet with Amanda and me and two
other associates Monday morning. We should be able to complete a snapshot of
the documents in the office by mid Tuesday. Our discussions raised the
following issues:

	. Dave said Enron has a small generating subsidiary located near
Palm Springs, Enron Wind Energy. It generates and sells power to utilities.
The Enron subpoena asks for generation data. We will contact them Monday by
phone.

	.EES has a small office in Long Beach. Amanda will talk to their
employees Monday.

	. A Master Limited Partnership, EOTT Energy, also has an office in
Long Beach. They may be a subsidiary of Enron Corp. Please let us know if we
should contact him.

	. Many documents in San Francisco are covered by confidentiality
agreements with Enron's clients. Dave said the confidentiality of these
documents are not clear on their face and we should involve an Enron
attorney in Portland -he suggested Karen Jones- to work on this issue with
us.


	Document Retention: David said he is concerned that there is no
clear corporate guideline for e-mail retention in his office. We should send
him and the directors in that office (as well as all EES directors)  a clear
directive as soon as possible. For the time being he is following oral
instructions not to delete e-mail or other documents. Earlier, Amanda talked
the EES IT manager, who said that it is not possible to automatically save
e-mail from most EES personnel in California (those who are on the legacy
e-mail system). Until we solve this problem I suggest we retain the daily
back-up tapes made  for the legacy system (just as we are doing for our
Portland office).

	Telephone call with AG's office  regarding the EES subpoena: This
afternoon I talked to Hirem Pattel, a deputy AG who is temporarily in charge
of the EES investigation. I told him we would produce some documents without
waiving our objections, but needed to discuss any production with him
beforehand. I repeated Bob's offer to meet next Friday. He said they would
not meet with us until we again responded to the subpoena and said in
writing we would produce documents. I told him we had no obligation to do
that and wanted to meet with them first. He then said he would have his
supervisor call me early next week.

	Directives to California officers: All the EES and Enron people we
have talked with in the past two weeks have been cooperative. Given the time
crunch, however, it would be helpful if an Enron lawyer could contact
California officers and ask them to make special efforts to help us with the
document review. The people to contact are Messrs. Reilly, Parquet;McDonald,
Mara,Wright, van Ulden, and the head of the Enron Wind Energy Office.

	Review of EES documents at San Ramon: Amanda Smith spent the morning
today there and gathered documents underlying the UC litigation. Lockyer
knows this litigation and will probably use our positions in it to gauge our
compliance with any production agreement. We will complete an assessment of
these documents early next week.  We also found and took custody of the
backup tape made in San Ramon May 25. Apparently no similar tape exists for
Costa Mesa. We will identify and obtain earliest back-up tape that exists at
that office.

	As we review documents for privilege we should know the identity of
all Enron lawyers. Bob, could someone in your office act as a contact person
to supply us with this and similar information?

The cygwin implementation of rename goes like this:

1) Try to use MoveFile
2) Try to use MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)
3) Try to unlink destination, then try to use MoveFile

And as you say, Cygwin claims it meets POSIX.1. And, POSIX.1 says, ""If 
newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to
a few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which 
another process attempting to access newpath will find it missing."" 
Clearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is 
not being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename 
will not be atomic.

Also note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe 
also suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.

A customer is looking for a book that may have been written about the disappearance in June of 1972, of a young boy (Adrian McNaughton) in the Holmes' Lake area of Brougham Township in Renfrew County (Ottawa Valley area of Ontario). He was 6 years old at the time.

She recalls having seen something about it in the past (other than printed news reports. Perhaps a bound official report? An article in a magazine?).

Any information or leads (even a ""yes - there is"" or ""no - there isn't"") would be much appreciated.

Kindest regards - John Lynch.

Featuring: 

Give Me the Simple Life ... But Not Too Simple  
 
The Chinese Entrepreneurial Spirit
 
A Very Attractive Play on Solar Cells 
 
-------------------


Sometimes, when the pace of the modern world gets to be too much, you hear
people talk about how they'd like to scale things back, slow down and get
in touch with a simpler reality.  I've even thought about that myself,
from time to time, although I'm also quite fond of the conveniences of
modern life.  

But that was before the storm last Wednesday that dropped six inches of
wet, Spring snow on southern New Hampshire.  By the time my wife and I
woke up on Thursday morning, our power was out, and our home phone service
was another casualty.   

This isn't all that uncommon here in New England, and in Dover, New
Hampshire where we live, it's usually a matter of a few hours before power
is restored.  But the powers that be didn't get our power back on until 45
hours later, thus giving me the taste of the simpler life that I may have
been yearning for without knowing it.   

When I got home Thursday night, my wife had brought in wood from the
woodshed and had the wood stove in our basement and the fireplace on the
first floor blazing merrily away.  We declined the opportunity to dirty
dishes that we couldn't wash and went out to eat in a part of town that
was still blessedly electrified.  

There followed a picturesque evening with us reading and doing crossword
puzzles by candlelight while sipping tea (since we could still light the
gas range with matches).  All very lovely.  

Friday morning, after 45 minutes of hauling a day's worth of wood from the
woodshed (and noticing the huge fallen pine limbs that illustrated where
the power had gone) and washing my hair with a pitcher of water heated on
the stove, it all seemed a little less idyllic.  I missed my water heater,
my iBook, my electric lights and my steam heat.  This life may be simple,
but I'm not stupid.  

Anyway, given my position as editor of the Cabot China & Emerging Markets
Report, this got me to thinking about people living in mud brick homes out
in the provinces of China who have been living like this for centuries,
without even the running water and flush toilets that have kept the veneer
of civilization intact back home in Dover.  

The communist revolution in China made a huge difference in the lives of
many city dwellers.  But for many peasants, life stayed pretty much the
way it had always been.  Maybe a People's Army medic would be available
and eventually the village might get a TV, but not much else changed.   

Then came the post-Mao era, the unleashing of the Chinese entrepreneurial
spirit and the new Chinese saying ""To get rich is glorious!""  In other
words, The People's Republic of China became the People's [capitalist]
Republic.  And in less than a decade, cell phones, TVs, Internet cafes and
computers began spreading throughout the Middle Kingdom.  

The real lesson here is that while the communist revolution may have been
powerful, the most powerful force in the world is the revolution of rising
expectations.  Once people get a taste of modern life, they like it.  And
once they have it, they usually want more. 

In part, of course, it's the way that magazines, newspapers, movies and
the Internet show you the world of possibilities for the stuff you could
have.  But even more important are the images that modern media give you
about how you could live.  There are more people now living in freedom
because they kicked out their own leaders than there are people who were
freed from their leaders by outside forces.  If the communist party in
China knows what's good for it, it won't make a habit of standing in the
way of the Chinese people's desire to do what they want.  But I don't want
to get into politics.  

To bring this little disquisition around to investing, I'd like to point
out something from an earlier era that I really am nostalgic for ... clean
air.  Many of the best things in the modern world depend on electricity,
and most electricity is generated by burning stuff.  And almost every car
on the road is doing just the same thing.  Steel mills and other
factories, ditto. 

The answer to the riddle about how to have what we love about the modern
world, but without fouling our air, has been out there since the 19th
Century, but it's about to come into its own.  Photovoltaic cells, the
little slabs of doped silicon that power our calculators and keep remote
highway signs alight, are steadily moving toward the tipping point at
which the power that they produce - renewable, non-polluting power - will
rival the cost of power that comes from coal-fired generators. 

On the consumer side, this process is being helped along by countries like
Germany, Italy and Spain, and U.S. states like California that are
offering generous subsidies and rebates to encourage the use of clean
photovoltaic electricity.  And on the manufacturing side, different
manufacturers are using all kinds of strategies to lower costs, including
techniques to make thinner silicon cells, using alternative materials and
streamlining the manufacturing process. 

One of the stocks leading this charge found its way onto the recommended
list of my Report last week.  It's not First Solar, a U.S. manufacturer
we've written about before that's making cells that use less silicon. 
Instead, it's a Chinese solar cell manufacturer that's working on a number
of fronts to get the cost per kilowatt moving toward that long-sought
break-even point.   

The company is called Trina Solar (TSL), and it has the kind of innovative
management that will be needed if the cost per kilowatt is going to keep
heading down.  Consider the company's approach to its silicon feedstock. 
Both the solar cell industry and the semiconductor industry use the same
highly purified silicon as their basic material.  There's a lot of waste
in the process, including broken and contaminated wafers, machining
wastage and the like.  Most companies don't have the capability of
recycling that waste, but Trina Solar does.  And given the persistent
shortage, that's a major advantage.  Trina Solar is also on the way to
being a totally vertically integrated operation, with every step in
manufacturing under the company's direct control on one site.  Some day
there may come a huge breakthrough in the solar industry that will vault
some company into undisputed leadership in the industry and send its stock
into orbit.   But for now, it's Trina Solar and companies like it making
small improvements and finding small advantages that are winning the
battle to get electricity from the sun cheaply enough to make a
difference.

============================

Just by way of contrast, you might want to take a look at Evergreen Solar
(ESLR), an American manufacturer of solar cells that takes a unique
approach to saving silicon.  Evergreen melts its silicon, then runs two
specialized strings through the liquid, creating a film of silicon between
the strings like a flat soap bubble.  The cooled film of silicon can be
used to make very thin solar cells without the wasteful process of sawing
wafers.  ESLR took a big hit when the company lost its supply of silicon,
falling from 17 a year ago to 7 in January, but it has rebounded to near
11 on good contract news, and may have turned the corner.  

By way of contrast with Trina Solar, it's interesting to look at Solarfun
Power Holdings (SOLF), another Chinese solar cell maker.  The company's
stock came public last December and roared from 10 to 17 in just a couple
of months.  But the company issued disappointing projections on gross
margins in early March, and the stock dropped quickly back toward 12.  Our
preference for Trina Solar is only partially based on the company's
technological advantages.  It's also based on the importance that we
attach to positive momentum in a stock's price.  There are lots of
companies whose stock should be going up because of some great patent or
technological edge.  But in the world of aggressive growth investing, we
think there's no substitute for a stock price that indicates that
investors are actually signing on.  So we'll stick with Trina Solar, for
now.  From innovative sources of silicon feedstock to a totally integrated
manufacturing facility, this young company, and its even younger stock,
make for a very attractive play on turning sunlight into electricity and
making the planet happy to boot.

I use goal-directed evaluation (backtracking) heavily, mostly to
implement predicates of the form ``there exists an X such that P(X).''
I occasionally find other uses.  I wish there were an equally nice way
to write ``forall'' predicates (I usually negate everything in sight
to get an ``exists'' predicate).

Hi Jelmer,

I'm not quite sure what you have in mind, and I don't know if this is
relevant, but just in case...

In libsmbclient, we care about client-side configuration which may differ from
the server configuration.  Here, in pseudo code, is what it does:

    // Try to load a personal smb.conf file
    if (lp_load($HOME/.smb/smb.conf) != SUCCESS)
    {
      // If that failed, try to load the system smb.conf file
      if (lp_load(dyn_CONFIGFILE) == SUCCESS)
      {
        // If that succeeded,  allow local changes by appending settings
        // in their personal smb.conf.append file.
        lp_load($HOME/.smb/smb.conf.append)
      }  
    }

This handles the case where one wants to have their own entire smb.conf file,
but also where the system-wide smb.conf file should be used but a few changes
to its settings made for client use in smb.conf.append.

Cheers,

Derrell

I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

I finally debugged the problem: The _conform.map has filenames starting

The distribution filenames are all lowercase (eg, fxxxxxxxx and dxxxxxxxxxxx)
Just edit _conform.map and change all uppercase F and D's to lowercase.
It works just fine.

In fact I do, but I have myself somewhat in a sandbox as all the mail handling 
stuff except kmail runs as an unprivileged user, and kmail pulls incoming 
from that mailbox in /var.  I've been doing that for about 2-3 of years, 
started it back at FC2.  And running as root since RH5.1.  Yeah, I'm an 
un-repentant old fart.

a03cramerman@attmail.com,Multiple recipients of list <wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu>,"Tue, 20 Dec 1994 12:32:55 -0600",NEW SUBSCRIBER,"Hello to the Wind_Erosion Conference.

My name is Dick Amerman.  Those of us foolish enough to go by
middle names usually have to explain -- you may also see my name
as C. Richard and Carroll R.

I am a member of the Agricultural Research Service National
Program Staff, stationed in Beltsville, MD.  Although I am a
hydrologist by training and research experience, I have the task of
keeping track of the Agency's erosion program - wind and water.
Therefore, I am interested in anything having to do with erosion -
state of the art knowledge, research programs anywhere (who, where,
what, etc.), research progress, the customers we serve and their views
of their problems, the politics of erosion, social impacts, etc. etc.   I
work with colleagues at Cooperative State Research, Education, and
Extension Service (CSREES) and am interested in State Agricultural
Experiment Station (AES) work on erosion as well as ARS.
Incidentally did anybody ask Wayne Murphey to join the
Conference?  Berlie Schmidt? Maury Horton?  -- I'm at home on
leave for the holidays and don't have access to the original invitation
list.

For the past eight years or so, ARS has been focusing closely on
developing a process-based replacement for the Wind Erosion
Equation that we are calling WEPS - Wind Erosion Prediction
System.  Larry Hagen at Manhatten is the contact on it.  We have
also developed RWEQ - Revised Wind Erosion Equation that is in
preliminary testing with the Natural Resource Conservation Service
(NRCS) now.  Bill Fryrear at Big Spring is the contact on that one.

A first version of WEPS should be available for NRCS initial testing
this coming fall.

We realize that WEPS and RWEQ will continue to consume
considerable time and other resources in the ARS wind erosion
research program.  However, we hope to be able to return some
resources to other wind erosion research besides prediction
technology development.  To that end we are beginning discussion
about what the wind erosion priorities are and how we ought to shape
the ARS program for the future.

I will welcome anyone's thoughts regarding wind erosion research
topics and their ideas of priorities.  I will remind you that all the
federal agencies, ARS, CSREES, and NRCS included, will in 1997
have to conform to the Government Performance and Results Act
under which agency performance will be judged on ""outcomes"" and
customer satisfaction.  The way it looks now, outcomes will largely
be judged from their societal effects.  Technical excellence is a
prerequisite to good societal effects, but such technology must be
RELEVANT to society's needs and in USEABLE FORM in order
that it may be picked up, used, and have that desirable impact.  I
think outcomes from the new prediction technology will serve us all
well for a few years.  We can afford to get into some basic and
applied research, but need to have a strategy for assuring that results
from such research get put into forms that result in significant
outcomes several years down the road.

I hope that SAES scientists and others will join in discussion of the
ARS wind erosion program.  ARS should know what SAES and
others are doing and planning to do in order to avoid undue overlap.
Also, maybe we can leveradge each other's work - there are mighty
few people working in wind erosion research, and we need to make
the best use of all the resources collectively available to us -- and do
it in such a way that contributions to outcomes are attributable.

Tried that too. Still give the same problem. Although I thought 
it's the .htaccess job to locate those Perl's lib path.

How do you do that?
I can't see any directive related to that. Please advice.

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

=================================

03:20 p.m., 04/09/07, Update: Soyuz docks with space station

A Russian Soyuz spacecraft carrying two fresh crew members and a wealthy American space tourist docked with the international space station today to close out a two-day orbital chase. The linkup at the downward facing port of the Russian Zarya module occurred at 3:10 p.m. as the two spacecraft sailed high above Eastern Europe.

On board the Soyuz TMA-10 were spacecraft commander Oleg Kotov, Expedition 15 commander Fyodor Yurchikhin and U.S. software developer Charles Simonyi, who paid the Russians more than $20 million to become the fifth private citizen to visit the space station.

""Contact and capture, docking confirmed, at 11:10 p.m. Moscow time (3:10 p.m. EDT),"" said NASA commentator Rob Navias from the Russian mission control center. ""Docking confirmed, a perfect arrival. Soyuz TMA-10 has arrived at the international space station.""

Martha Stewart, a close friend of Simonyi who attended launch at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, was on hand at the Russian control center in Korolev for today's docking.

Yurchikhin and Kotov will replace Expedition 14 commander Mike Lopez-Alegria and cosmonaut Mikhail Tyurin, who were launched to the station last Sept. 18 aboard the Soyuz TMA-9 spacecraft currently docked to the aft port of the Zvezda command module.

Lopez-Alegria, Tyurin and Simonyi will return to Earth aboard the TMA-9 spacecraft April 20 after a 12-day handover period to familiarize the incoming cosmonauts with space station operations. Astronaut Sunita Williams, who joined the Expedition 14 crew in December after launch aboard the shuttle Discovery, will remain aboard the station with Yurchikhin and Kotov, returning to Earth aboard the shuttle Endeavour later this summer.

Lopez-Alegria eclipsed the American single-mission record of 196 days April 2. With landing April 20, the new record for longest time aloft on a single mission by a U.S. astronaut will stand at 214 days. Williams will beat that mark and set a new U.S. single-flight endurance record when she ultimately lands aboard Endeavour.

Ie if you are getting a little orange LED when you plug it in then your PSU
is probably working.

You would need to set your system up to do this for you, possibly parsing logs
or some other MTA-related tool, but it's not a function that SA provides by itself.

However, since this isn't a bug in SpamAssassin, I'm going to close out this
ticket.  If you want to ask for help regarding this on the users@ list, please
feel free to do so.

Ok, Forsyth has this exact setup up and running.  I can send out the
war story of his if you want.

Re: Market. I am not sure if going commercial with plan 9 will change
anything any more.  I wish it would, for then I would not have to
program or manage MS-Windows/X11 et al. when I go out to work.
The fact that I am paying for college by adminstrating large unix
boxen is annoying enough as it is.

Plan 9 is very nice but I am not sure if it can make it commercially.
MS-Windows: the stuff nightmares are made up out of.

	List of accomplishments for Rob Benson

	1. Made a fast and profitable transition from cash cinergy trader to term PJM trader.
	2. Current P/L is over $67,000,000, budget for the year was set at $15,000,000.
	3. No losing months, worst month was positive $2,700,000.
	4. Very high return on VAR, don't have actual numbers ( sorry ).
	5. Done two customer load following deals, both have turned out to be very profitable.
	6. Exceeded all EOL goals, both number of trades and volume. Each month I'm in the top 3 in east power for number of trades and volume.
	7. Have always stayed within my VAR limits
	8. I have become the market for all PJM trades, both on and off peak.
	9. My P/L has come from intra-day trading as well as an underlying fundamental position in both on and off peak. P/L did not come from just one big move.
	10. Have always put on positions based on my fundamental view, even if that view differed from others on the desk.

I think I now understand your comments. I've used snow and Rmpi quite
a bit. But the problem with Rmpi (or, rather, MPI) is the lack of
fault tolerance: if a node goes down, the whole MPI universe breaks,
and thus the complete set of slaves. Setting up some kind of
fault-tolerant scheme with Rserve seemed possible/simpler (as it does
not depend on the MPI layer).

(Yes, maybe I should check snowFT, but it uses PVM, and I recall a
while back there was a reason why we decided to go with MPI instead of
PVM).

Aha. I should have seen that. I think I understand the differences better now.

Yes, sure. I think that should be doable, though, if I decide to try
to go down this route.

No, as I've found in:
# postconf | grep smtpd_proxy
smtpd_proxy_ehlo = $myhostname
smtpd_proxy_filter = 
smtpd_proxy_timeout = 100s

Hm, so that looks strange - there is no before-queue but mail is

Not that I know of, and it is a moving target.  (E.g. I asked recently 
about some anomalies in the S4 bit introduced for 2.4.0 and what the 
intended semantics are.)  I've said before that I believe we can only 
help solve some of the efficiency issues with S4 if we have a technical 
manual.

It is unfair to pick out S4 here, but the 'R Internals' manual is an 
attempt to document important implementation details (mainly by studying 
the code), and that has only got most of the way through src/main/*.c.

Yes I've been using the suggested scripts however there appears to be a 
problem with the template checksums.

 From what I've read these jigdo checksum errors are normal when there's 
a new release?

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

Can't say I spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management

If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Buzzword.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes

Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

raises new questions about the definition of a planet. The icy world
2002 LM60 has been dubbed ""Quaoar"".

ASTRONOMERS SLICE AND DICE GALAXIES

New views of star birth and the heart of a spiral galaxy have been
seen by a state-of-the-art astronomical instrument on its first
night. The new spectrometer has a revolutionary ability to 'slice'
any object in the sky into sections, producing a three dimensional
view of the conditions throughout entire galaxies in a single
observation.

I think the only place where the ""plan 9 model"" is dramatically
different is in window system software.

There's a large amount of unix software that fits plan 9 just
fine, and it would be awfully stupid to reinvent wheels when
there's genuinely new things to work on instead...

OK, so you want a Greek character and not a Greek symbol.  As I said they 
are different (different fonts, different shapes aka glyphs).

a <- ""A)""
b <- ""stbA::cat""
paste(a, ""\\u0394"", b)

(Number from http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/greek.html .)  This should 
work in a UTF-8 locale and also on Windows (in a windows() device or in 
the Rgui console).

Out there, who is actually gotten p9 running? (that is, you've
got a distribution and you've installed it and gotten a
usable system up and running)

Of those, how many still have their Plan 9 partition/machine?

Of those, how many log onto it regularly, or use it as their 
system of choice?

How about configurations - who is using what? SPARCS? x86's?
Dedicated file servers? WORM drives?

If a Plan 9 archive site opened, would you want to use 9P
to talk to it, or FTP? What would you want to upload? What
would you want to see there?

How many people at your site use Plan 9? How many
develop or do research on it? What are they doing?

Of particular interest would be development work - I think
we should have a better idea of what the rest of the world
is doing, to avoid messy duplication.

Post your answers or mail them to me, and I'll strip out
locations/identities if you don't want to publish to the
world that you're running a system that
1) has a user `none' that can be accessed from anywhere, and
2) can listen to a Ethernet promiscuously
Oops - that just slipped out. I'm not trying to give bozos
ideas (you can't telnet in as none from outside our department
anyway) but some better way of controlling access to the
`none' account better be dreamed up (not everyone has the
luxury of a firewalled system). Grumph.

Another random question while I'm on - are there any good,
high-speed point-to-point interfaces to hook up PC's at a
fairly short distance (say 0.5m)? It strikes me that most
networks are overkill for linking a file server and cpu
server, given that they are designed for many hosts and
fairly large distances. Neither of these factors apply to
a cpu/fs link. A cheap solution to the above would be
appreciated.

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep, because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

Selected References  on  Topics  Related  to  Creationism  prepared  by  the
Geoscience Research Institute for Pastors, Primary and Secondary Teachers

Ager, Derek V.  1981  The nature of the  stratigraphical  record.   2nd  ed.
John  Wiley  & Sons, New York.  An aggressively committed evolutionist gives
an impressive presentation of the  necessity  of  a  catastrophic  model  to
account for geologic features.  122 pages.

Anderson, J. Kerby & Harold G. Coffin.  1977.  Fossils in focus.   Zondervan
Publishing  House,  Grand  Rapids,  Michigan.   Part  of  a  series intended
especially for college and university students. Lays out both  creation  and
evolution  models  and shows  how the fossil record best fits the former. 95
pages.

Bliss, Richard B., Gary E. Parker, & Duage T. Gish.  1980.  Fossils: key  to
the   present.   Creation-  Life  Publishers,  San  Diego,  California.   An
elementary introduction to fossils and to evolutionistic  and  creationistic
interpretations of the fossil record.  81 pages.

Bliss, Richard B., & Gary E. Parker.  1979.   Origin  of  life:   Evolution,
creation.  Creation-Life Publishers, San Diego, California.  A well-written,
well-illustrated,  brief  presentation  of   contrasting   creationist   and
evolutionist  explanations  for  the  origin  of life.  Suited for secondary
level, and appropriate for use in public schools.  51 pages.

Bowden, M. 1977.  Ape-men--fact of fallacy?  Sovereign  Publications,  Kent.
One  of  the  few  book-  length creationist analyses of the fossil evidence
bearing on the origin of man.  If offers a typical creationist treatment  of
ancient  man fossils, emphasizing the sketchy and often fraudulent nature of
the evidence.  Although the interpretive emphasis of the book is exaggerated
and  often  mistaken,  it  contains  much  useful  information  not  readily
available in the standard scientific literature.  196 pages.

Clark, R.E.D.  1961  The  universe:   plan  or  accident?   Fortress  Press,
Philadelphia.   A  scholarly  presentation  of  the  evidences from physics,
chemistry, astronomy, and biology for creation  by  a  Supreme  Being.   238
pages.

Coffin,  Harold  G.   1977.   Earth  story.   Review  &  Herald   Publishing
Association,  Takoma Park, Washington, D.C.  A non-technical volume covering
most aspects of creationism and its relation to Scripture.  Useful for  non-
scientists  and junior and senior high-school students.  Well illustrated in
color.  190 pages.

Herald  Publishing  Association,  Takoma  Park, Washington, D. C.  A general
reference covering the topic of creation; evidences for creation,  evidences
for  a  universal flood, discussion of fossils, geologic processes, geologic
time, speciation and the evolutionary theory.  494 pages.

Coppedge, James F.  1973.  Evolution:  possible  or  impossible?   Zondervan
Publishing House, Grand Rapids, Michigan.  An excellent popular treatment of
probability  considerations  in  molecular  biology   from   a   creationist
viewpoint.   The  presentation  is  enlivened  and  clarified  with striking

illustrations.  The reader should exercise  caution  in  utilizing  material
from  Chapter  12  in  which  the  author  uncritically  summarized from the
creationist literature a wide range  of  viewpoints  of  topics  other  than
molecular biology.  276 pages.

Denton, Michael.  1985.  Evolution:  A theory  in  crisis.   The  Hutchinson
Publishing Group.  17-21 Conway St. London W1P 6JD England.  One of the best
recent books on the problems of evolutionary theory.  368 pages.

Gish, Duane T.  1979.  Evolution:  the fossils say no!  3rd  ed.   Institute
for  Creation  Research,  San  Diego,  California.  A well-written paperback
which clearly and fairly discusses the fossil record with emphasis on  early
man.   Evolutionary  and  creationist  interpretations  are contrasted.  190
pages.

Grasse, Pierre P.  1977.  Evolution of living  organisms.   Academic  Press,
New  York.   Translation  from French of a well-written, and often humorous,
work in which a respected evolutionist scholar  arguing  from  biochemistry,
molecular   biology,  paleantology,  and  genetics  presents  evidence  that
generally has been recognized by the creationist community.   In  presenting
his  arguments,  Dr.  Grasse  retreats  one  step  short  of  recognizing  a
transcendent agency working in and through nature.  297 pages.

Hitching, Francis.  1982.  The neck  of  the  giraffe:   Where  Darwin  went
wrong.   Ticknor  &  Fields,  New  Haven,  Connecticut.   Discussion  of the
problems with Darwinism and the neo-Darwinian synthesis  in  explaining  the
processes  of  evolution.   Chapter 5 discusses the creation viewpoint.  The
author rejects creationism and hopes that biologists will  discover  another
model to explain how evolution occurred.  288 pages.

Javor,  George  T.  1979.   Once  upon  a  molecule.   Southern   Publishing
Association,  Nashville,  Tennessee.   A  brief, non-technical discussion of
chemical evolution, written by a competent biochemist.  31 pages.

Lester, Lane  P.  &  Raymond  G.  Bohlin.   1984.   The  natural  limits  to
biological  change.   Zondervan  Publishing  House,  Grand Rapids, Michigan.
Examines the concept of change in species and rejects  both  gradualism  and
punctuated  equilibrium  as  being  inadequate  models  of change.  Proposes
instead that changes in species occur by loss  of  genetic  variability  and
that there are limits to the amount of change possible.  207 pages.

MacBeth,  Norman.    1971.    Darwin   retried.    Gambit   Inc.,    Boston,
Massachusetts.   An  important  work by a lawyer who, while not presenting a
case  for   creationism,   points   out   inconsistencies,   confusion   and
contradictions in the classical evolutionary theory.  178 pages.

Roth, Ariel A.  1982.  The universal flood debate:  the  response.   Liberty
77(6):12-15.   Geologic  evidences  supporting  the  concept  of a worldwide
flood.

Roth, Ariel A.  1984.  The  trend  toward  catastrophism  in  geology.   The
Adventist  Review  161(24):9-  11.  A non-technical review of the increasing
evidence of rapid changes in the past.

Roth, Ariel A.  1986.  Some  questions  about  geochronology.   Origins   13
(2):64-85.    A   review   of  time-dependent  factors  that  disagree  with
geochronological  interpretations  requiring  billions  of  years  for   the
development  of  the  crust  of the earth and the evidence of life contained
therein.  Factors considered are:  rates of erosion, sediment deposition  in
the  ocean, rate of sediment accumulation on the continents, rates of uplift
of  mountains,  production  of  volcanic  ejecta,  growth  rates  of   human
populations, and time required for evolutionary organization of life.

I think we should not need to do that; find_method will just hand back a 
null PMC if it fails to find a method, and then we can test that and 
throw an exception if it is null.

Any objections? Otherwise I'll remove this comment in the next couple of

I think everybody has their own version of this,
but in case it's useful.. (only tested on Linux):

find $* \( -type f -o -type l \) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 |
xargs -r0 du -b --max-depth 0 |
sort -k1n |
grep -v ""^0""

Pdraig.

Editor's Note


Prizes and Awards: It's That Time of Year


'Tis the season for prizes, or so it seems anyway. For starters, Edmund M. Clarke, E. Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.
Moving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored ""for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,"" Griffiths ""for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,"" and Mumford ""for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions."" The three share a $100,000 award.
This year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited ""for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics."" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.
Back in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.
And finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. 
Congratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.

 Yes, it is possible to prove any regular inequality E1 =< E2 (as well as
any regular equation E1 = E2) in a pure algebraic way -- without
constructing DFA's for the expressions involved.

 1.  As far as regular equations are concerned, such a way has been
described in [1].  It is an algebraic calculus presented in the form
of a term-rewriting system. I have written a program in OBJ3 (an
algebraic programming language) implementing this calculus.  If
someone is interested in getting the program (together with quite
complete instructions how to run it, examples, etc.), send me please a
request by e-mail.

 2.  Since E1 =< E2 is equivalent to E1 + E2 = E2, the abovementioned
calculus can also be used for proving/disproving regular inequalities.
However, there exists a more direct (and more efficient) algebraic
procedure based on so-called ""partial derivatives"".  Below I outline it.

 Consider the set Reg of regular expressions on a given alphabet A:

  Reg ::= 0 | 1 | x | Reg . Reg | Reg + Reg | Reg *

where 0 denotes the empty language, 1 is a unit language, x is a letter
from A, and the three other operations -- concatenation, regular union,
and Kleene star -- have standard meaning.

 Let Reg0, Reg1 be subsets of Reg defined by the following grammars:

  Reg0 ::= 0 | x | Reg0 . Reg | Reg . Reg0 | Reg0 + Reg0

  Reg1 ::= 1 | Reg1 . Reg1 | Reg1 + Reg | Reg + Reg1 | Reg *

One can check that Reg is a disjoint union of Reg0 and Reg1 and that for
any a0 \\in Reg0 and a1 \\in Reg1 the inequality 1 =< a0 is false and 1 =<
a1 is true.) 

 Let Set[Reg] denote the set of all finite sets of reg.  expressions.

DEFINITION ( [3] ) 
 Given x \\in A, the function d_x : Reg -> Set[Reg], computing the set
of partial derivatives of its argument w.r.t. x, is defined
recursively by the following equations:

  d_x(0) = d_x(1) = {} (* an empty set *),
  d_x(y) = if y == x then { 1 } else {} fi,
  d_x(a+b) = d_x(a) \\cup d_x(b),
  d_x(a0.b) = d_x(a0).b,
  d_x(a1.b) = d_x(a1).b \\cup d_x(b),
  d_x(a*) = d_x(a).a*

for all y\\in A, a,b \\in Reg, a0 \\in Reg0, a1 \\in Reg1.  Here the
extension of concatenation _._ to Set[Reg] is defined in the following
way:

  R . 0 = {}, 
  {} . t = {},
  {0} . t = {},
  {1} . t = {t},
  {a} . t = {a.t} if a =/= 0, a =/= 1,
  (R \\cup R').t = (R.t)\\cup (R'.t)

for any R, R' \\in Set[Reg], t \\in Reg, t =/= 0, a\\in Reg.
--------------------

  Given a set R \\in Set[Reg], let \\sum R be either 0 if R={}, or a sum
(regular union) a + b + ... of non-zero elements a, b, ... of R. Note
that here the regular union _+_ is considered to be associative,
commutative and idempotent (while in the above definition of d_x() all
regular expressions are treated as free terms).


DEFINITION ( [2] ) Given a, b \\in Reg, x\\in A, and p \\in d_x(a), the
inequality p =< \\sum d_x(b) is called a ""partial derivative of a regular
inequality a =< b w.r.t. the letter x"".
  Let pd_x(a =< b) be the set of all partial derivatives of a =< b w.r.t.
x.  Given a set S of inequalities, let pd_x(S)=\\bigcup_{s\\in S}pd_x(s).
------------------

 Iterating this definition, one obtains partial derivatives of a =< b
w.r.t. non-empty words on A:

	pd_{wx}(a =< b) =  pd_x(pd_w(a =< b)).

for all w\\in A^+, x \\in A.


THEOREM ( [2] ) 
 1.  The set 

	PD(a=<b) = \\bigcup_{w\\in A^+} pd_w(a =< b) 

of all possible partial derivatives of a =< b w.r.t. all non-empty words
on A is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to
\\let(a)*2^\\let(b) where \\let(r) is the number of occurrences of alphabet
letters appearing in the reg.  expression r.

 2. If a =< b is a valid inequality (i.e., the regular language denoted by
a is a subset of one denoted by b), then all its partial derivatives are
also valid. If a =< b is not valid, then the set PD(a =< b) contains at
least one ""trivially inconsistent"" inequality of the form p1 =< q0 where
p1\\in Reg1, q0\\in Reg0.  
------------------


 This gives the following procedure to decide whether a regular
inequality a=<b is valid:

 1. Check if a=<b is ""trivially inconsistent"", i.e. if a\\in Reg1, b\\in
Reg0 -- then a=<b = false. 

 2. Otherwise, compute the set pd_x(a =< b) for all the letters x
occuring in a. If one of the new inequalities is ""trivially
inconsistent"", then a=<b is disproved. Otherwise, keep computing partial
derivatives of new inequalities until either you get a ""trivially
inconsistent"" inequality, or the set of inequalities becomes saturated
(no new partial derivative can be obtained). In the latter case, a=<b is
valid -- as well as all the obtained partial derivatives of a=<b.

(See [3] for a natural way to compute partial derivatives through
so-called non-deterministic linear forms).


 This is indeed a decision procedure, but its efficiency can be
drastically improved using simple ""logical"" observations. First, it's
quite clear that it makes no sense to differentiate inequalities like

         a =< a, a =< a + b, 0 =< a, 1 =< a1 

etc. which are ""trivial tautologies"". These should just be removed from
the set of inequalities to be checked. Second, if two inequalities of the
form a =< b and a =< b + c occurs in the set, then the second one can
also be removed, since it is a logical consequence of the first one.

 It is proved in [2] that with these optimizations the procedure in some
cases is *EXPONENTIALLY* faster that any one constructing DFA for the
expressions involved -- you can check it yourself on the following
example:

   (a* b)* (a a ... a) a *  =< (a + b)* a (a+b)...(a+b)
            ^-------^                     ^------------^
             n times                        n-1 times 

(it is known that the minimal DFA for the right-hand side has 2^n
states, but our procedure -- with the optimizations described above --
generates only n+2 partial derivatives to be checked).

Could you post an example of this?  I'm very curious to see what it is you
are doing.  I would also like to see what type of ""forall"" predicates you
want to implement.

The initrd was built picking up info from /etc/fstab.  You may have to 
make temporary changes to fstab, run yaird to produce a new initrd for 
the partition where you are going to run it (and remember to backout 
changes to fstab).  I have been able to boot a Debian on an USB-HD, it

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

"""Rainer, Eva"" <Eva.Rainer@ENRON.com>",chapmagj2@dow.com,"Fri, 13 Jul 2001 10:25:04 -0500",Napoleonville land sale,"
Gary,

Per our conversation on July 11, I would like to reiterate that an Enron entity is interested in selling approximately 330 acres of land at the Napoleonville salt dome in Louisiana.  This land is divided into two tracts, one of about 256 acres and the other about 73 acres in size.

Enron recently received $15,000 per acre in a separate land transaction at Napoleonville, and this sets the market price that we expect to receive in the above proposed land sale.  

Does Dow have interest in this land?  Is this price within your range?  If so, I would encourage you to draft a proposal from Dow within the next two weeks, if possible.  

This email does not constitute an offer, but is solely provided for informational purposes.  

Let's discuss this at your earliest convenience.  Thanks again for taking the time to meet with me last Thursday, and I look forward to hearing from you soon!  

Sincerely, 
Eva Rainer

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)

No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.

The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't
contract law.

This isn't the first time copyright attorneys have stumbled on this
subject.  I'm sure it won't be the last.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

Mike Haertel <mike@skinner.cs.uoregon.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Tue, 08 Feb 1994 17:26:21 -0500",rumours of plan 9 going commercial,"For some reason various people on this list have been
floating rumours about plan 9 going commercial.  I think
this is ludicrous.  At best, wishful thinking; at worst,
confusing to others on the list.

I don't think Plan 9 has any real chance of going commercial.
First of all, the entrenched momentum of the Unix/X11 and
DOS/Windows markets is too great.  I am essentially the
only person here who uses Plan 9; I have tried to find
other recruits, but between a shortage of hardware and the
""what do you mean it doesn't have EMACS?"" syndrome, it is
an uphill battle.

Secondly, remember AT&T sold USL to Novell.  I think this
makes it clear that AT&T doesn't really want to be in the
business of selling operating systems.

So basically, forget it.

However, I think Rob Pike has said that they are trying
to get Plan 9 publicly released.  I assume he means as
free software along the lines of awk or sam.  I believe
this is the only way Plan 9 will ever have a chance to see
the widespread use it deserves, and so I hope very much
that this happens.

So some guy failed to reach the source, but instead got spin doctor to
deny it.  Wot, is he thick enough to expect official confirmation
that, yes, Blair is going around casting aspersions on Bush???

It's an amusing anecdote, I don't know if it's true or not, but certainly
nothing here supports the authoritative sounding conclusion ""Status: False"".

Hi Corry,

Since the new sheets are going to be a little more fussy, and the alias thing harder to fix or maintain, I would like to get the enpower short codes changed to things that are more workable and make sense.

See how these grab you:


AQUILACORP -- AQUILA (The canadian ones can stay long for differentiation)

DUKEENENTRA- DUKE (But is there another Duke that is just Duke already?)

MSCAPGP - MORGAN

EDISONMISIM - EDISON

IDACORPENE - IDACORP

PINNACLEWE - PINNACLE

AVISTAENE - AVISTA


I have a few west specific ones, but wanted to check with you for these.

Lemmie know.

   ,  not exists( targetDir   || ""w"" || nn )

works, but the separation of the 2 ""not exists"" calls is reminiscent
of Algol-family languages' need to code things like
   if importantNumber = 1 | importantNumber = 2
where Snobol-family languages could just test whether
   importantNumber = 1 | 2
Analogously, Icon should be able to factor out the 2 ""not exists"" calls.

But this
   (  nn := (0 to 9) || (0 to 9)
   ,  not exists( (downloadDir|targetDir) || ""w"" || nn )
   )|stop( ""No names of the form w[0-9][0-9] were unused."" )
doesn't work because DeMorgan's Law doesn't work:
if downloadDir || ""w"" || nn doesn't exist, exists() fails, not exists()
succeeds, & the expression succeeds, without ever testing whether
targetDir || ""w"" || nn exists.

So far, this
   (every nn := (0 to 9) || (0 to 9) do {
      (exists( (downloadDir|targetDir) || ""\\\\w"" || nn ), next) | break
   })|stop( ""No names of the form w[0-9][0-9] were unused."" )
is the best I can do, but I dislike it because it makes use of a very
obscure aspect of break; Griswold & Griswold 1990 p19 doesn't even mention
it, altho it's in Appendix C on p285. (BTW, p19 seems to imply incorrectly
that break only works with while & until, even tho every was introduced on
p16; & Appendix C doesn't clarify this.)

Can anybody suggest a more elegant expression?

Can anybody suggest a language extension that would help?

hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have ""NeoMagic""
you need to have
Driver ""nvidia""

Here is part of my XF86Config

Also note that using the card you are using you 'should' be able to safely

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

"""Gordon V. Cormack"" <zixgfqei@uwaterloo.ca>",Multiple recipients of list <hgbiputh@nist.gov>,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 19:51:09 -0400",TREC 2007 Spam Track,"
We are still in the process of finalizing the TREC 2007 Spam Track
guidelines.  This is an interim report.  We should have the final
guidelines by the end of June.  In the meantime, please feel 
free to post queries or comments to this list.

The primary tasks will use the same tool kit and data format as
last year; i.e. the TREC spam filter evaluation toolkit available
here:

    http://plg.uwaterloo.ca/~gvcormac/spam/

The active learning task will use a different version of the 
toolkit, to be available shortly.

The three tasks are:

    On-line filtering with immediate feedback.  
        - exactly the same task as for TREC 2005 and 2006

    On-line filtering with delayed/incomplete/noisy feedback.
        - same tools as for the TREC 2006 delayted feedback,
          but the test data may not contain ""train"" commands
          for every message, and some of the ""train"" commands
          may be wrong so as to simulate user underreporting
          and user error.

          Emphasis will be placed on correct classification
          of a large number of messages with no feedback.
          (For example, there may be no feedback for the
          last half of the messages)

    On-line active filtering with active learning.
        - different tools and task from TREC 2006 active learning
          Filters will perform on-line classification as for the
          other two tasks, but will be allowed to query the
          true class (ham or spam) of a fraction of the messages,
          chosen by the filter.  This will be effected by an
          additional command ""query"" added to the toolkit:

               query 

          where  is a message previously classified
          by the filter.   


Filters will be submitted to NIST (date to be determined, but
probably mid-July) after which a public corpus will be released.
Results on the public corpus will also be submitted to NIST
(probably late August).

I should clarify this:  In Unix, most programs take standard input
and produce standard output.  The same is true in Plan 9.  So when
I said the plan 9 model is mostly the same, I was thinking of how
you run programs, not how you write them.  The incompatibilities
are a bit more dramatic from a programmer's point of view.

Thanks for starting a great thread here. Like others, I would like to
hear a summary
if you make one.

My institute uses R for internal data processing and analyzing. Below
are some of our reasons, and yes cost (or lack thereof) is not the
only one.

First, prior to the rise of R we already had a number of people using
Splus, and our
main compute server had licenses for Splus. As the institution moved
from Sun Unix
servers to Linux workstations and servers, the licensing issue became
important. Having
to service many licenses (one per workstation, and several on the
servers) is time consuming for overworked IT staff. Furthermore, our
Splus programs that ran routinely on the servers
could all be easily made run on R. Hence, this was really a no-brainer.

Second, R runs on both windows and linux (and solaris and macs,-
although the last one is not really an issue for us). We have made
some user programs that are tailor-made for the work we do, these we
bundle into R packages, that then can be used on both windows and
linux. This was a very important consideration for us.

Third, user community. Even with commercial solutions (such as Matlab)
the quality of the
user community is very important, - if we had felt that R did not have
an active and responsive community we probably would have been more
hesitant. Needless to say
R has an incredibly active community which makes it an attractive environment.
Furthermore, other institutions in our field are also adopting R, at
least in the research departments.

Fourth, R is a good choice for many of the things that we do (data
analysis of varying complexity, good graphics, maptools [working with
shapefiles] etc). It was therefore an obvious candiate for us from the
start.

Now, R does not have everything we want. One thing missing is a decent
R-DB2 connection, for windows the excellent RODBC works fine, but ODBC
support on Linux is  a hassle. The big file issue is there, but many
of our files are GRIB which is a format that is  generally not
supported by anyone.... Furthermore, object graphics, ala pythons
matplotlib (and of course  Matlab) is not there, but would be very
handy. However, that being said, it is easy to make publication (print
and web) quality graphics with R. And of course as always with Open
Source if you miss something bad enough why not do it (or have it
done) yourself and add it to the package.

We have not used R much for large NetCDF datasets, there are other
tools (such as
the CDO package, which also supports GRIB) that are better oriented for this.

We have used R on solaris, Linux (several different flavours) and
Windows (since W98).  We currently use it on our primary production
servers (RedHat Enterprise Edition), but we have not used it in a
parallel setting. We have not used R for making on-the-fly
calculations and graphics for the web, although this is clearly
possible.

I hope this helps, I have found  this thread to be a good one.

Sincerely,
Halldór

Subject:	Internet Advertising agreement

Mark -- I am working with the East power desk to purchase space for an EnronOnline banner ad on a PJM website.  We are buying 7 ads at 500/month/ad for 3 months ($10,500 total).  They are running this ad as a pilot program offered for only 3 months.  I am attaching the agreement they sent to us.  I would like to revise section 2.01 to state that EnronOnline has first right of refusal to keep the ad on their site if they extend the program after three months.  Could you help me revise this agreement?

Thanks

Kal

SALT LAKE CITY -- A unit of Williams (NYSE: WMB) completed construction of expansion facilities on its Kern River natural gas transmission system on July 1. Williams filed an application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15 for a certificate of approval to proceed with the expansion project, adding 135,000 dekatherms per day of firm transportation service from Wyoming to California.
 ""We received FERC approval within three weeks of filing - an unprecedented turnaround. This allowed us to expedite the construction process and bring additional supplies of natural gas to the California market,"" said Kirk Morgan, director of business development for Kern River. ""We anticipate most of the new natural gas will go directly to power generation facilities."" 
The emergency expansion project added two new compressor stations in Utah and one in California, as well as upgraded compressor units at three existing compressor stations in Wyoming, Utah and Nevada. The installation of these facilities increased the transportation capacity on Kern River by approximately 19 percent. Williams completed the multimillion project more than three weeks ahead of schedule. 
""The extraordinary effort put forth by our contractors, employees and permitting agencies resulted in a successful completion of the project ahead of schedule,"" stated Micheal Dunn, manager of project management for Kern River. 
With a system that spans the continental United States, Williams' gas pipeline unit is one of the nation's largest-volume transporters of natural gas. The company is based in Houston and has offices in Salt Lake City and Owensboro, Ky. The gas pipeline unit's Kern River Gas Transmission operates a 922-mile system delivering Rocky Mountain and Canadian natural gas to markets in California, Nevada, and Utah. The expanded system has a design capacity of 835 million cubic feet per day.

This I find a little surprising, but maybe it's just a sign that I'm
not experienced enough with R yet.

I can't use R for big datasets.  At all.  Big datasets take forever to
load with read.table, R frequently runs out of memory,  and nlm or
gnlm never seem to actually converge to answers.  By comparison, I can
point SAS and NLIN at this data without problem.  (Of course, SAS is
running on a pretty powerful dedicated machine with a big ram disk, so
that may be part of the problem.)

R's pass-by-value semantics also make it harder than it should be to
deal with where it's crucial that you not make a copy of the data
frame, for fear of running out of memory.  Pass-by-reference would
make implementing data transformations so much easier that I don't
really understand how pass-by-value became the standard.  (If there's
a trick to doing in-place transformations, I've not found it.)

Right now, I'm considering starting on a project involving some big
Monte Carlo integrations over the complicated posterior parameter
distributions of a nonlinear regression model, and I have the strong
feeling that R will just choke.

R's great for small projects, but as soon as you even a few hundred
megs of data, it seems to break down.

If I'm doing things wrong, please tell me.  :-)  SAS is a beast to work with.

This is a bug report for perl from hzyoze@fysh.org,
generated with the help of perlbug 1.35 running under perl v5.8.8.


-----------------------------------------------------------------
[Please enter your report here]

This perl is configured with 64-bit integers and 64-bit floats (1+52
bits of significand).

$ perl -lwe '{ package t0; sub mynum { 36028797018963971 } use overload ""0+"" => \\&mynum } print int(t0::mynum); print int(bless({}, ""t0""))'
36028797018963971
36028797018963968
$

36028797018963971 is 2^55+3.  Its salient feature here is that it's
a native integer that can't be exactly represented as a native float.
When it's returned by the ""0+"" overload function, it's being unnecessarily
and lossily coerced to float.  This coercion doesn't happen if the
return value of t0::mynum() goes directly into int() without going via
the overloading system.

[Please do not change anything below this line]

I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

Chris

White House: President's ""War Boner"" Must Be Satisfied

...""The President can't seem to hide his excitement about a possible
military conflict with Iraq. At a recent function honoring America's
war widows, Bush sported a visible erection when his speech turned to
the subject of the Middle East.

'Believe me when I say this. With or without the help of other
nations, with or without UN approval, we will penetrate Iraq's
borders. With overwhelming force, we will pound Iraq over and over
again without ceasing. And, once its leaders concede defeat, we will
seed Iraq with American-style democracy.'

Aides say the podium was scrubbed down thoroughly after the event with
a special cleanser/biocide not used since the Clinton
administration."".....

Good Morning Fellas,

In anticipation of the next testing opportunity,  I am going to use June 20th as my target date.  Can you please clear out the routes for that date at all West Points, I am going to evaluate more complicated routing and pathing next.

I will wait to test until given the go-ahead by you.

Log Message:
Handful of changes I've been running with for quite awhile.  The only truly
functional change was to make MinTTL a global and set it to one day.  It was
set to 0.  The other stuff:

    * print messages to stderr
    * use ""not container"" instead of ""len(container) > 0""
    * be a bit less aggressive in our pruning

Thank you very much ! Your sample code is very helpful.

In linear separable problem, I should use fda by linear regression
instead of bruto unless taking some dimensional reduction process,  
should I?

Cheers.

Steve Kotsopoulos <steve@ecf.toronto.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Mon, 13 Jun 1994 23:30:18 -0400",summary of Plan 9 BOF (birds of a feather session),"I scheduled a Plan 9 BOF at the Usenix conference last week.
About 40 people attended, but only a few had Plan 9.
Many of the others were either from commercial organizations
(and wish they could get it), or from universities without licences.
We were pleased that Rob Pike and Dennis Ritchie were able to attend.

I started the BOF by telling people how they could obtain licences, and
pointed them to the ftp archive on research.att.com for more information.
I also said that I was thinking of setting up my own ftp server, to
collect sources from the user community. I feel there may be some users
out there who have written software, but haven't made it available
to others because they don't have an anonymous ftp server.

If anyone has something they would like to make available to all the
other Plan 9 licencees, please send me mail. I'll post a notice to 
this list once the ftp service is online.

After the preliminary remarks, Rob Pike was kind enough to answer
a wide variety of questions. I'll summarize what I remember:

A new Plan 9 distribution will be worked on this summer, but it is unclear
if it will be distributed. Please don't deluge the developers for more
information regarding the licencing and release details.

It will have acme and a fax service, and updated versions of alef, acid &
authenticaion services.  The PC kernel now supports sound boards.
The default porting base will be for PC's instead of Sparcs and Magnums.
If legal details can be worked out, the Plan 9 developers hope that this
CD will also be released publicly, so that anyone can buy it
(again, this is what they HOPE ... no promises).

Brazil is their current research project. It looks like Plan 9 on the
outside, but there have been many internal changes. Most importantly,
the kernel data paths have been shortened to improve throughput.
Rob re-wrote the window system for Brazil in alef (in 4 days).

Someone asked ""why do we need another new language [alef]?""
Rob explained that alef is a concurrent object-oriented language,
and this makes it much easier to write some kinds of programs.
Two examples were given.  The fax package has a coroutine that loads
the next page of fax while you are reading the current page. This
was relatively easy to add in with alef.
Also, for programs like the window system, which manage several different
input and output devices, alef makes the program smaller and easier
to write (once you've mastered concurrent programming).

A new audio compression algorithm has been developed by the acoustics
researchers at Bell Labs. It gives 13:1 compression (mpeg gives 4:1).
A new network has been developed by Phil Winterbottom.
It is called Planet (built with PLA's), and can handle 300Mb/s.

Many of the questions had to do with licencing ... I don't recall
any details other than what I have already written.

Vijay Gill <vijay@gl.umbc.edu>,9fans plan9 users list <9fans@cse.psu.edu>,"Fri, 04 Feb 1994 10:37:08 -0500",Gnots,"
Seeing the overwhelming response to my nofileserver.ps offer, I am
hoping to get deluged likewise with requests to sell me a Gnot ;)
Actually, I was wondering if any Gnots are available commercially.
And please, no sun 3/50's.  I want the Gnot.

Now onto some more questions:

There was a post about creating comp.os.plan9.  What happened?

I think I saw somewhere that plan 9 was going to go primetime,
i.e, commercial.  Any people in the know able to confirm/deny?

Just wanted to let you know that we finally have some of our proofs 
available on-line.  It isn't our whole book, but it is a fair sample.  I 
think they got most of the pictures of you guys posted if you are interested 
in buying a print.  I believe you can order directly from the page.

If anyone wants to see more, call Andrea or myself and we can help you out.

Steps for accessing the proofs are:

1.  Point your browser to ""www.elanphotography.com""
2.  From the home page, select ""Weddings""
3.  From the Weddings page, select ""On-line Ordering"".  This will open a new 
browser window to a list of weddings shot by our photographer.
4.  Select the ""Childers/Luebbering"" wedding.
5.  This will prompt you to enter a username and password.
       Enter:
          username: childers
          password: gnirebbeul
6.  Browse at will.  I believe there are three or four pages of proofs.  If 
you drill down on a picture, you can order it there.

Let me know if you have any problems accessing this site.

Later,

Jason

***********************************************
I'm sending you information about our Global Change Master
Directory (GCMD) information system, a metadata service directing
users to Earth Science/Global Change research data.

My primary responsibility is to populate the system with descriptions
of earth science datasets available to researchers. If you or your
colleagues are interested in listing data sets in the GCMD or could
direct me to someone who has important data that should be known to the
community, please contact me. The following few paragraphs will give
you an overview of the system and access procedures. At your time,
take a few minutes to read and feel free to try a session or two.
Good luck in your research!

                The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD)

The Global Change Master Directory (GCMD) project originates from NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center's (GSFC) Global Change Data Center in
Greenbelt, Maryland.  A multidisciplinary database, the GCMD contains
nearly 3000 data set descriptions of national and international remote
sensing, in situ, and ground observational data. The U.S. contributors
include NASA, NOAA, USGS, DOE, NBS, EPA, NSF, NCAR, and universities,
while international holdings from Canada, Argentina, Brazil, Europe,
Africa, Russia, Japan, and Australia are represented.  The
descriptions provide information such as geographic and temporal
coverage, spacecraft/sensor, investigator, data contact, storage
medium, parameters measured and derived, discipline, location,
summary, and data quality. Some descriptions are provided with an
automated connection to an external system for more detailed
information, browsing, and data ordering capabilities.

The GCMD hosts a 'home page' on the World Wide Web (WWW) featuring
direct-querying via controlled fields and free-text Wide Area
Information System (WAIS) searches of the GCMD, GCMD News, lists of
data sources, and GCMD Documentation.  The home page also provides
access to the Committee on Earth Observing Satellites' (CEOS)
International Directory Network (IDN), comprised of nodes in North
America (NASA/GSFC), Europe (European Space Agency Earthnet Programme
Office (ESA/EPO)), and Japan (National Space Development Agency
(NASDA) Earth Observation Center).  The construction and maintenance
of the GCMD home page and underlying hypertext links is a
high-priority activity of the GCMD staff, with new information added
weekly and monthly.

The GCMD home page can be accessed using WWW browsers such as Mosaic
or MacWeb and the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) address
http://gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov/. Mosaic and MacWeb provide 'Forms'
capability whereby users can submit queries directly to the GCMD
database from the home page. The GCMD client can also be accessed via
telnet gcmd.gsfc.nasa.gov. and login as 'gcdir'. The client will
recognize your workstation and give you the X-window or ASCII
interface.

To access the NASA/GSFC node via modem, set to 8 bits, no parity, 1
stop bit, dial (301) 286-4000 (9600 baud) or (301) 286-9000 (2400
baud), Enter number: SISC, CALL COMPLETE <CR>, Username: YOUR NAME,
Local: c gcmd, login: gcdir

To access the European node, NSI/DECnet > $Set Host 29628, USERNAME:

Steve Kotsopoulos <steve@ecf.toronto.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Tue, 31 May 1994 16:34:45 -0400",setting up a cpu server,"I have 2 Magnums, one is a terminal, the other is a cpu server.
Both use u9fs as their file server.

When I try to telnet into the cpu server, the connection closes right away.
I get the following message in /sys/log/listen:

plan9: May 31 12:28:20: bootes: aux/listen: tcp call for tcp23 on chan /net/tcp/3

Other tcp services don't work either (similar messages in logfile).

When I try to use the 'cpu' command on the terminal, it prints:

cpu: can't read server challenge: plan9: file does not exist

And I see the following message in /sys/log/listen:

plan9: May 31 12:28:47: bootes: aux/listen: il call for il17005 on chan /net/il/2

UDP services such as bootp and tftp seem to work fine, as I can boot the
terminal from the cpu server.

How can I get cpu & TCP services to work?

Hmm, I am currently running plan 9 on a generic 486 dx/33 no name clone 
with 4 megs of ram and 120 megs of hard disk while waiting for our PC's 
to come in.  Using a unix filesever to bootstrap, I now have a stand 
alone plan 9 system.  There are a couple of problems, I keep running out 
or ram (with a 20 meg swap partiontion), swap /dev/swap doesn't seem to 
do much for me.  The system is nice, but thats about it.

For the machine, disable shadow ram, and life will be much easier if you 
have a magnum to set up as a fileserver.  If you don't, you really need a 
unix system which can run u9fs, this makes life infintely easier when 
trying to copy over the files.  Other than that, I'll let Forsyth, Capel 
et al, handle this, they are much more familiar with this than I am.

> In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX.

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

Is it just me or has there been a massive increase in the amount of email 
being falsely bounced around the place? I've already received email from a 
number of people I don't know, asking why I am sending them email. These 
can be explained by servers from Russia and elsewhere. Coupled with the 
false emails I received myself, it's really starting to annoy me. Am I the 
only one seeing an increase in recent weeks?

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

Top StoryGetty ImagesTo the Moon and BackThe StoryNASA’s Artemis I mission is set to take off.Let the countdown begin. For the first time in nearly 50 years, NASA is launching a mission to the moon — using its most powerful rocket ever. There won’t be any astronauts on board. But today’s launch is a crucial test that marks the start of NASA’s eagerly awaited new lunar program. Now — specifically, at 8:33 am ET — it’s time for blast off. (Here’s how to watch.)Mission details, Houston. The mission’s spacecraft will travel more than 1.3 million miles around the moon over the course of 42 days. But ultimately this is all about preparing to bring humans back to the moon as soon as 2025...for the first time since 1972. NASA hopes to reach the moon’s unexplored south pole, where there might be ice in craters to support future crews. And it hopes to lay the groundwork for future missions to Mars by using the moon’s surface for training and testing.theSkimmNASA’s return to the moon has been decades in the making and cost billions to fund. Now it’s time to see whether the long-awaited program will give us the moon, or if expectations will have to come back to Earth.  And Also...ThisWhat’s got us trying to read in between the lines…The Mar-a-Lago affidavit. On Friday, the Department of Justice released a heavily redacted 32-page affidavit. It’s the document the FBI used to get a warrant to search former President Donald Trump’s home in August. The affidavit confirms that secret documents were recovered from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. Reminder: back in January, Trump’s team returned 15 boxes of government documents to the National Archives after taking them home from the White House. The affidavit says those included 184 documents labeled as “secret,” “confidential,“ or “top secret.” And contained info about “clandestine human sources“ (think: spies or informants) that could have been dangerous in the wrong hands. Fast forward to August: the FBI went back to Trump’s residence with their warrant, and found 11 additional sets of classified documents. The DOJ hasn’t commented beyond the release of the affidavit, but in June it said the documents hadn’t been “handled in an appropriate manner.“ Trump’s spokesperson says that there was no reason for a search and that it’s “all politics.” Who’s saying ‘I did it first’…Moderna. Last week, the Massachusetts-based company sued Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech for patent infringement. Moderna says that Pfizer and BioNTech hit copy and paste on its mRNA tech for their COVID-19 vaccine. Moderna claims it filed the patents way back between 2010 and 2016. The company pledged not to enforce its patent when the pandemic was in full force. And it says it isn’t trying to get Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines off the market now. But it wants companies to respect its intellectual property and request proper permission to use its work. Both Pfizer and BioNTech responded that their work is original, and say they’ll defend themselves in court.…Oh and speaking of vaccines, the Biden admin is expected to have Omicron-specific boosters ready around the week after Labor Day.What’s got parents talking…Missouri. This summer, Cassville R-IV School District in western MO gave the ‘OK’ to bring back spanking. The district told parents that it would start swatting students with paddles as a punishment for misbehavior. Kids would only be spanked if their parents give written permission — with a choice to opt out later. The district also claims it will only swat kids as a last resort and that it will not be done in front of their peers. Other rules: two workers must be present (the spanker and a witness) and they cannot hit students in the head or face. The measure is a school board response to a survey sent to parents, students, and staff, which found that parents were worried about student behavior. Many states have outlawed corporal punishment in schools — but Missouri is one of 19 that still allow it.Who’s GOAT us in our feels…Serena Williams.

 The sad news is that there seems to be a lot of patents (pending or not)
that's for very basic/general ideas; it's the current form of ""domainnapping"",
and it might turn uggly when people start trying to enfoce these patents.

---------------
About SSL tests
---------------

An open bug about missing SSL tests (#451607) was brought up to close or keep
open. Jean-Paul Calderone mentioned an improved testing method by spawning a
'openssl s_server' for testing purposes. This sparked some talk about the
terminating of subprocesses in a cross-platform manner (See `Cross-Platform
Subprocess Termination`).

Contributing thread:

- `About SSL tests
`__

-------------------------------------
Cross-Platform Subprocess Termination
-------------------------------------

Because os.kill only works on *nix and OS X platforms, leaving Windows
platforms uncovered. Although subprocess.TerminateProcess exists for Windows
platforms, it requires the use of handles and additional overhead for use.
Support was overall given for adding a UNIX-only signal() method and a cross-
platform terminate() method to Popen instances. Nothing was said of actually
incorporating these changes into the subprocess module, although code was
given.

Contributing thread:

- (This was mixed in with the `About SSL tests` thread.)

------------------------
Extended buffer protocol
------------------------

Updates to the buffer protocol are discussed, along with the proposal pre-PEP
documenting the updates for Python 3000, but brought to Python-Dev, due so the
plans of backporting to 2.6 afterwards.

(Note: I couldn't summarize this well enough to cover much of it do any real
degree, but it is currently a Py3k issue, so maybe that is OK. If no one wants
to add to the summary, it will stay short.)

Contributing threads:

- `Extended buffer PEP
`__
- `PEP 3118: Extended buffer protocol (new version)
`__
- `Extended Buffer Protocol - simple use examples
`__

-----------------------------------------
function for counting items in a sequence
-----------------------------------------

A patch was submitted by Steven Bethard (http://bugs.python.org/1696199),
implemented a discussed collections.counts() function to provide a mapping
between items in an iterable and the number of times they appear. There were
suggested names, but none overthrew the original 'counts()' and a question of
items not appearing being counted as 0 or raising a KeyError, with 0 winning
due to a just-makes-sense factor.

Contributing thread:

- `function for counting items in a sequence
`__

----------------------------------------
context manager - generator interaction?
----------------------------------------

A problem was brought up with iterator context managers and iteration inside
the with-block raising its StopIteration, but being caught by the context
manager mechanics. It was also responded that the problem would not exist
without the use of overly broad try blocks, and this lead to the addition of
a formal note in PEP 8 about keeping narrow try blocks.

Contributing thread:

- `context manager - generator interaction?
`__

-----------------------------
proposed which.py replacement
-----------------------------

Suggestion of replacing the which.py script in the Tools directory migrated to
its proposal for inclusion into the standard library. A patch and tests have
yet to be provided.

Contributing thread:

- `proposed which.py replacement
`_

-----------------------
minidom and DOM level 2
-----------------------

What is missing for DOM Level 2 support in minidom was highlighted and
some work jumpstarted.

Contributing thread:

- `minidom and DOM level 2
`__

----------------------------------------------
test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?
----------------------------------------------

Differing buffering behavior was causing test_pty to block only in verbose
mode. Solutions may include reading to clear the buffer of child processes
before a waitpid() call.

Contributing thread:

- `test_pty.py hangs in verbose mode on Mac OS X?

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

# grep /home/dude /usr/bin/*
Binary file /usr/bin/aaxine matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gentoo matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gphoto2 matches
Binary file /usr/bin/gtkam matches
...

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build
directory. It would be nice to find out which and fix it, but I am using too
many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

We are running plan9 on both pc and sparc machines.  We also have
a cpu server (sparc) up and running.  When the cpu server is running,
a ""who"" on the file server, will show that both ""adm"" and ""bootes"" are
running.  Fine.  Frequently, this same inquirery will show 
""none"" and ""adm""!  When this happens, the distributed system is *very*
sluggish.  We have to reboot the cpu server to get rid of ""none"".

What is happening?  What is the significance of ""none"".  Why does it take
over bootes' place?  We believe that an error from the an ethernet
card may cause this.  What is the reason for having ""none"" run at all?

Thanks in advance for any info.

"""Matt Cardier"" <mcardier@hotmail.com>","""Forteana List"" <zzzzteana@yahoogroups.com>","Wed, 28 Aug 2002 20:42:14 +1000",[zzzzteana] Compensation for World's youngest mother,"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html

LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 

Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 

At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 

Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 

But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 

""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 

""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 

'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 

""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 

Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 

Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 

Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 

One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 

He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 

Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 

There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 

Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 

Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 

More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 

One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 

But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 

But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" 

Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 

Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 

After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 

He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 

Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 

She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 

He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 

He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 

""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 

As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 

""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""
Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

 Playboy wants to go out with a bang 
 
 
 AN AGEING Berlin playboy has come up with an unusual offer to lure women into
 his bed - by promising the last woman he sleeps with an inheritance of 250,000
 (160,000). 
 
 Rolf Eden, 72, a Berlin disco owner famous for his countless sex partners,
 said he could imagine no better way to die than in the arms of an attractive
 young woman - preferably under 30. 
 
 ""I put it all in my last will and testament - the last woman who sleeps with
 me gets all the money,"" Mr Eden told Bild newspaper. 
 
 ""I want to pass away in the most beautiful moment of my life. First a lot of
 fun with a beautiful woman, then wild sex, a final orgasm - and it will all
 end with a heart attack and then Im gone."" 
 
 Mr Eden, who is selling his nightclub this year, said applications should be
 sent in quickly because of his age. ""It could end very soon,"" he said.

Maybe. That is in fact what I am wondering. However, an easier route
might be to try Rmpi with papply. Or snow (with either Rmpi or rpvm).
Or nws (a Linda implementation for R). Using Rmpi with papply, in
particular, is a piece of cake with embarrasingly parallel problems.
papply is like lapply, but parallelized, with built-in load-balancing,
although it will run sequentially when no MPI universe is available;
the later is very handy for debugging. snow also has parallelized,
load-balanced, versions of apply (though I do not think it
automatically switches to running sequentially).

All of these (Rmpi, papply, Rmpi, rpvm, nws) are R packages available
from CRAN. You will need some additional stuff (LAM/MPI for Rmpi ---or
mpich if you run windows---, PVM for rpvm, and Python and twisted for
nws).

(I asked about Rserve because the lack of fault tolerance of MPI is a
pain to deal with in my applications. Also, with LAM/MPI there are
limits on the number of slaves that can be handled by a lam daemon,
and that is a problem for some of our web-based applications. Thus, I
am looking at alternative approaches that might eliminate some of the
extra layers that MPI ---or PVM--- add. ).

HTH,

Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.

Just for the record mc has a nice directory

I'm really hesitant to bring this up...  but the main barrier to me to
making Plan 9 my major environment is the disdain for emacs.  I
*really* appreciate having an editor that is programmable down to its
bones, in something like a real programming language.  It's not that
I'm addicted to left-meta-shift-coke bottle style interfaces, but...
I really don't understand the ""this page intentionally left blank""
attitude.  I mean, the fact that you can build things like ange-ftp
and WWW mode is *really* nice!  How do accomodate the same sort of
thing in sam?  And I don't know how to function without emacs' gdb
mode!  The fact that the editor itself can put me at the line where
the music stopped, and I've got a full honest-to-God editor under me
without having to go, ""Uh.. lessee.. that was line 136 in file
blurfle.c.."".  And when I recompile, I have all of the error messages
in a buffer, and need two keystrokes per syntax error (which adds up
if you've got enough syntax errors ;-) to page through them and fix
them -- again, with a real editor.

And then there's guess-indent mode that does about as good a job as I
can at figuring out where I probably wanted the cursor after the line
wraps, and abbrev mode, which now auto-corrects all of my most common
typos -- watching somebody's face when I type ""taht "" and they see the
""a"" and the ""h"" switch places as soon as I hit the space is kind of
fun.

There's lots that I don't like about emacs, but the fact that it's
*programmable* means that my productivity as a programmer and generic
computer professional is about an order of magnitude higher than it
would have been if I didn't have it.

The most common complaint that I hear about emacs is that there are
too many blasted things to learn -- and the learning curve *is* really
steep.  But that doesn't seem to be the reason for the intentional
blank page in the Plan 9 manual.  Would somebody please enlighten me?

Zvi Lamm <mslamm@pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il>,icon-group@cs.arizona.edu,"Wed, 28 Dec 1994 16:07:53 +0200",Truth-Table generator,"
I had a need to write a program to output truth tables for boolean
expressions. I used the programmming language J (a sister of APL). The
'program' was about two lines long.  I wrote a program for the same task
in Icon. I include it below.  This Icon solution is ugly (because of the
programmer, not the language..), but works. I would be happy to hear
comments. Any idea for improvemnet is welcome. 

I got alot of help on comp.lang.apl when writing the J version - so don't 
let me down! I think I will write a short note comparing the solutions. 
My idea is to show the way different languages shape your thought. Both J 
and Icon are rather special in that they give the programmer tools not 
found in other languages. Does this interest anyone? 

Any way, here goes:

#
# Truth-Table genertor Ver -1.0
# 12.1994
#
procedure main()
        n:=2
        m:=2 # number of expressions

       # every write(Outl(t:=Truth_Table(n)),""--> "",Expr(t));

        # shows many expr to many truth-table lines

        every {
                #write(repl(""-"",2*n-1+1+4*m))#
                t:=Truth_Table(n)              & #------------------------#            
                write("" "")                     & #<-force line break when #
                writes(Outl(t))                & #  backtracking          #
                every writes("" | "",Expr(t))      #------------------------#
              }  

end

procedure Truth_Table(n)
#
# generates lines (as lists) of the truth table for n variables
# works, but is ugly
#
        tabl:=list(n,0)
        every i:=0 to 2^n-1 do                   # all lines
                {
                    j:=i;                        # convert number to bits
                    k:=n;
                    while (j > 0) do
                        {
                             tabl[k]:=j % 2;
                             k:=k-1;
                             j:=j / 2;
                         }

Intellectual propriety
Anuradha Rajivan
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/OPINION/Editorial/Intellectual_propriety/articleshow/msid-1858184,curpg-1.cms


As efforts are underway to revive World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks to bring the Doha Round to its logical conclusion there is an urgent need to take a fresh look at intellectual property rights (IPRs).

The debate has been driven largely by commercial interests. Public interest is equally, if not more, important. We need to understand that different situations may require different solutions balancing commercial interests with the public good.

Global institutions like World Intellectual Property Organisation that specialise in intellectual property, together with the WTO agreement on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) are increasingly influencing the governance of intellectual work.

Should intellectual work be subordinated to human well-being or to profit? Are the two necessarily contradictory? Is it logical to take different positions for different types of intellectual outputs?

While the argument for property rights favours financial gain as the best incentive, the contrary view is that strong IPRs inhibit innovation and development of new technologies with implications for biodiversity and concerns for the poor making medicines more expensive or farmers' seeds ineffective.

IPR issues are often seen as developed versus developing country positions the former with strong aggressive interests and the latter with more defensive interests. The balance of power is in favour of industrial lobbies in developed countries that have successfully increased the breadth and coverage of IPRs from trade secrets, utility models, and broadcasting rights to rights on data compilation.

However, the positions can well be reversed as in the case of traditional knowledge. IPRs do not have to be all or nothing. It is possible to take differing positions depending on the 'public good' nature of the product. The challenge lies in finding ways to balance rewards to the innovator while facilitating wider access and dissemination to spur further innovation and newer applications.

For instance, biotechnologies are at the cutting edge - in the laboratory and commercially. The original species for this research comes mainly from tropical countries rich in biodiversity. Corporations patent these resources after getting them from poor communities.

The US patent on turmeric for healing wounds is an example. While most corporations in the business see it as bio-prospecting, and demand strong IPRs, for poor communities this is bio-piracy as they lose out on fees worth millions of dollars for prospecting rights.

Adding value to traditional knowledge through geographical indications (GIs), is an excellent opportunity for developing countries to aggressively leverage commercial gains from IP. A GI identifies a good as originating in a specific region, with quality or characteristics attribu-table to its geographic origin.

Most GIs are used for relative luxuries like wine, spirits and cheese. Traditional knowledge can push the use of GI beyond luxury goods and whole communities can benefit. Examples are basmati rice of India and Pakistan, tea from Sri Lanka, Phu Quoc fish sauce and Hunza apricots. Another idea not yet utilised is GI in services like Thai massages and Asian hospitality.

A major area of concern is the implication for drug prices with the strengthening of IPRs in pharma-ceuticals. The cost of essential drugs is much lower in India than in neighbouring Pakistan - with different intellectual property regimes.

India has historically had 'process' patents, not 'product' patents, allowing domestic pharmaceutical companies to produce low-priced copies of patented drugs. This simple provision in the original Indian Patents Act (1970) increased competition and put pressure on pharma-ceutical companies to keep prices low.

India is the fourth largest producer of pharmaceuticals and a large supplier of low-cost generic drugs to other developing countries. As a signatory to the TRIPS agreement India was under pressure to modify its IP laws, to change to a 'product' patents regime. A 2004 amendment to the Indian Patents Act made the country WTO compliant but this was later reversed under intense domestic pressure.

Arts and entertainment is one area where the argument of public good for human well-being need not be an issue. Music, painting and film are the works of specific artists who should be compensated for the use of their work. Strong IPRs in these areas is less likely to compromise social good.
