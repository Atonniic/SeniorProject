Allen Emerson, and Joseph Sifakis received the 2007 Turing Award, the granddaddy of all computing awards, for their work on model checking, an automated technique for finding design errors in complex hardware and software. They share a $250,000 prize.
Moving from computing to mathematics, Pierre Deligne, Phillip Griffiths, and David Mumford are sharing the 2008 Wolf Foundation Prize in Mathematics. Deligne was honored ""for his work on mixed Hodge theory, the Weil conjectures, the Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, and for his contributions to arithmetic,"" Griffiths ""for his work on variations of Hodge structures; the theory of periods of abelian integrals; and for his contributions to complex differential geometry,"" and Mumford ""for his work on algebraic surfaces; on geometric invariant theory; and for laying the foundations of the modern algebraic theory of moduli of curves and theta functions."" The three share a $100,000 award.
This year's Crafoord Prize combined the fields of abstract mathematics with astrophysics. Maxim Kontsevich and Edward Witten received the 2008 Crafoord Prize in Mathematics from the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, while Rashid Sunyaev received the Crafoord Prize in Astronomy. Kontsevich and Witten were cited ""for their important contributions to mathematics inspired by modern theoretical physics."" Half of the $500,000 prize goes to Kontsevich and Witten, the other half to Sunyaev.
Back in the field of computing, the 2007 Gordon Bell Prize went to a team of scientists--Kyle Caspersen, James Glosli, John Gunnels, David Richards, Robert Rudd, and Frederick Streitz--from Lawrence Livermore National Lab and IBM for a unique simulation of a phenomenon known as Kelvin-Helmholtz instability on the BlueGene/L. These gents will divvy up a $10,000 prize.
And finally, there's the Dr. Dobb's Excellence In Programming Award, given this year to....uh, I can't tell you. It is still a secret. But the recipient will be honored in the upcoming April 2008 issue of Dr. Dobb's Journal and in person at the SD West 2008 Conference on Wednesday, March 5, 2008. For a list of previous recipients, visit Dr. Dobb's Hall of Fame. 
Congratulations to one and all for well-deserved honors.

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

Subject: RE: Azurix Global Insurance Programme


Sorry for the delayed response, however, I was not in the office last week.

Originally, on moving Azurix back into Enron CRM, it was decided to leave
Azurix on a separate insurance program to retain flexibility for potential
sale activity.  (We did combine them into the Enron Directors and Officers
Liability program as Azurix could no longer carry their own coverage,
following the ownership change.)

We have not considered the options in the event of a sale, should Wessex
and a select few assets not be included.  I understand that the current
liability limit maintained by Azurix is $600,000,000.  The Enron limit is
more than that.  As an Enron subsidiary, low liability limits are not
acceptable and in those cases where ""separate"" programs are purchased,  the
excess amount above the separate program is maintained here.  I am
traveling tomorrow and will return to the office Wednesday before noon.  We
need to meet and discuss.  I will phone you on Wednesday.

   Subject:  Azurix Global Insurance Programme

   John,

   Wessex has to start work around now on next year's budget - one of the
   first
   tasks for me to do is to come up with next years insurance costs.

   I am proposing to cost this on the basis of reverting back to a
   standalone
   insurance programme for Wessex as opposed to being part of the Azurix
   Global
   Insurance Programme.  The main reasons for this are:

   Following the hefty premium rise in 2001 the global programme is now on
   a
   par with a standalone programme with regard premiums but more expensive
   overall due to the much higher excess levels at Azurix.

   Due to the above it could easily be argued that the global programme is
   not
   offering best value for Wessex acting as a standalone company which of
   course it must do under its licence - this causes potential 'RAG 5'
   problems
   with the regulator.

   The levels of coverage previously enjoyed by Wessex prior to the global
   programme had been more than adequate for approximately 10 years.

   If AZX assets are sold this year there may be no need for an Azurix
   programme but to consider absorbing Wessex into any Enron programme will
   probably only add to the problems above given that Wessex and Enron are
   such
   diverse entities in terms of size, activities, locations and therefore
   insurable risk.

   Please could you confirm what I am proposing is OK with Enron.

   Regards.

   Mark Watts

   Treasurer

Is your group primary on the project now, or do I continue to send to someone else?  Let me know.  
Arctic Resources Gains Key Aboriginal Support for Northern Pipe 
Arctic Resources Co., the upstart that only last year entered the myriad of pipeline proposals to move northern gas into the Lower 48, moved a few steps closer to fulfilling its dream of building a pipeline from Alaska's Prudhoe Bay to Edmonton, AB, last week by earning the endorsement of key Canadian aboriginal leaders. 
The cornerstone of ARC's approach is to build a consortium of political, producer, transportation and regional leaders; without aboriginal support, the plan would never succeed. However, Bob Murphy, point man for Houston-based ARC, said Friday that if all continues to go well, ""gas could be flowing by 2006."" 
Last week, aboriginal leaders representing the Sahtu landowners and the Alberta First Nations agreed to endorse the project, including its approach to providing pipeline management by aboriginal and Native American groups involved in the governance of the project.  The Deh Cho, said Murphy, who also occupy a significant portion of the land through which a pipeline will travel, are now considering the proposal, and Murphy said he was optimistic. 
""Together, Sahtu and Deh Cho lands represent over 70% of the land in the Northwest Territories, through which a pipeline would travel,"" he said. Gaining aboriginal support is key to any pipeline to the Lower 48, he said. 
ARC's Northern Gas Pipeline Project would create a natural gas pipeline extending from Prudhoe Bay in Alaska through and under the Beaufort Sea, coming onshore in northern Canada and extending through the Mackenzie River Valley to interconnects in Edmonton. Following a ramp-up period, ARC estimates it would transport 4 Bcf/d through the high-pressure 1,200 mile, fully entrenched route. 
The pipeline would cost $4 billion, and financing and reserves would add another $1 billion to the cost, which would be 100% debt financed. The debt financing would lower the tariffs, making it attractive to shippers, promoters say. Murphy said he's hopeful that by the end of the year, ARC could begin its pre-application permitting process, but he added there was still much to be accomplished. 
""The ARC approach is all inclusive,"" Murphy told NGI. ""We fully intend to gain the support of all of the parties because we are offering a balanced approach to project management. We believe our approach is far more than just a route. That's important to understand. Our approach offers the least expensive, the lowest tariff,"" he said. ""Politically, we have to take care of Canadian interests. We have to take care of the political issues in Canada, and that includes bringing the aboriginal regions in. You have to do that to succeed."" 
ARC's proactive approach combines Canadian aboriginal and Native American interests that line the pipeline route with an independent business consortium under the company's umbrella, Murphy said. The balance of interests of the competing stakeholders offers the type of business discipline ""that will be required by the capital markets and industry."" 
What ARC gained last week was a Framework Memorandum, executed by the Ernie MacDonald Land Corp. (EMLC), one of six Sahtu landowners whose territory would be crossed by the pipeline. The memorandum was structured to include participation of other aboriginal landowners following briefings in their communities. The Fort Norman Metis Land Corp. also agreed to join EMLC as a signatory to the memorandum. 
EMLC President Larry Tourangeau said that he believed the ""interests of Canada, the United States, industry, the environment and aboriginal people are best served by an initial single, cost-effective pipeline that connects both northern Canada and Alaska to southern markets without damaging either Canadian or Alaskan resources."" 
What EMLC also likes, and what Murphy hopes ARC can convince other aboriginal leaders of as well, is that ARC will give the affected aboriginal regions control over the pipeline --- an approach not used by other competing proposals. ""We believe that aboriginal ownership and involvement, as proposed in the ARC approach, will improve the prospects for a safe, timely and economic project,"" said Tourangeau. 
ARC Chairman Forrest Hoglund, who spearheaded the efforts of former Exxon Corp. in its unfulfilled plans to build a natural gas pipeline from Alaska almost 30 years ago, said the endorsement of aboriginal leaders ""marks a major milestone to getting to the right answer quickly on this important project."" He called the ""one pipeline approach with aboriginal support"" the ""fastest, lowest cost, best environmental and best political approach"" for the region. 
Now it's on to gaining more support, and beginning the critical step of establishing a special purpose committee, Murphy said. The SPC would be organized and created under Canadian law and owned by certain aboriginal groups whose lands the pipeline crosses. Similar provisions would be offered for the Alaskan region, he said. 
Murphy said ARC is now working with the producers interested in an Alaskan pipeline, as well as political leaders in Canada and Washington, DC. When asked how producer involvement was going, Murphy said the companies were ""doing the type of work anyone would need to do"" to study which option would be best for their companies. 
""At the same time, we're certainly hopeful that they're going to want to perceive this route as the far more economical one and the one with the best political approach,"" Murphy said. ""Of course, the economics of the project matter, but politics matter too. Pipelines have to work economically and not just at $9 gas. This is a long-term project, and we've put a great deal of emphasis on the business sense of it."" 
ARC's proposal is not the only one on the drawing board, but so far, none have gotten further than the proposal stage. No applications have been applied for yet by any of the competing proposals, which include two other major proposals: 
The Alaska Natural Gas Transportation System (ANGTS): The ANGTS was approved in September 1977 by President Jimmy Carter and the U.S. Congress. The proposal envisions a 5,000-mile joint U.S.-Canadian overland pipeline that would deliver up to 2.5 Bcf/d to the Lower 48. Portions of ANGTS already have been completed, with more than 2,600 miles along two legs from Alberta into the United States. The statutory framework between Canada and the United States also still exists. However, this project has languished and environmental reviews still have not been completed. Costs for the unbuilt segments range between $7-$11 billion. 
The Central Pipeline Route would follow the ANGTS to just below the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, then travel southeast through the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge into the Northwest Territories and south into the Mackenzie River Valley into Alberta. This has languished mostly because of environmental protests of the route and less political support.

Your parents are lucky.

In Iraq, we had XP machines on a Department of Defence SECURE
NETWORK which was completely cut off from the rest of the
internet, and they STILL caught viruses.

We need to break the back of the mandatory bundling of Windows.
Personally, I think computers sold retail should be have line-item
costs, with Windows as a separate cost from the hardware.

It's just like payroll taxes deducted out of the paycheck --
what people don't have to explicitly fork over extra money
for, they soon forget (if they were ever aware of it in
the first place).

Hello!

Just to update - we've extended the auction deadline to 7 August to give people more time to get comfortable with the contract on the back of Transco delaying their 6 month auctions.

We are still refining the curve analysis - so I'll get in touch when we've got it together.

Hope all is well with you - say hello to Marcus.

Hello!

Congratulations on your new arrival - hope you are all well.  Got married on 26 May and got sunshine in Dublin on the day!

We are running the virtual entry capacity as an auction
bids due in on 9 July (may be extended if Transco delay their auction)
5 year minimum term
any terminal
we have right to refuse gas at the beach on payment of compensation chosen by customer in the bid.

We are still running analysis to produce beach curves based but current thinking is that 
current market inefficiency is inflating the price (we are currently buying day ahead interruptible Fergus capacity at 0.3p and buying gas as it turns firm on the day at NBP-7p)
our aim is to take out the conservative guys in our auction so the Transco auctions should be less ridiculous (summer max price was 12p but the average was 6p, with wide spreads in each auction round
we have modelled with Transcost to verify Transco's view that Fergus can be expanded by 50% for 1 p/th LRMC

Also we have some other risk management angles we intend to pursue if we end up with a large position 
offer underwriting on incremental investment by Transco
code modifications to increase capacity auctioned
build a pipeline! 

It would be great to get your views on it - shall I give you a call when we've pulled together the curve analysis?

Yes - mine is much simpler :-). I was just doing
the minimal thing that works for Vista.

Doing cacheprime isn't the same as the readahead()
system call on Linux. posix_fadvise is close enough
that I could squeeze it in....

This code gives a marked speed increase for Vista
clients when using explorer against Linux servers.

that does this. I want to address a different aspect of your question.

Your question implies that less interesting things belong at the bottom
of the summary output.  On the other hand, when I was teaching full time
I tried to convince my students that the summary output for lm models
(and others) should be read from the bottom up (and to some degree from
right to left).  After all, you really should not be looking at the
p-values for the individual coefficients until after you look at the
overall F-test p-value (at the very bottom), and you should not try to
interpret the coefficient values until you have looked at their standard
errors (and possibly p-values).  Anything that I want to know about the
residuals I learn from the diagnostic plots, not the 5 number summary
that is at the top of the output (I am not arguing for that to go away,
others may find it more useful than I do, and I do occasionally look at
it, but it seems least important of the output).  If your model includes
interactions and/or polynomial terms, then these should be looked at
before the main effects and linear terms (and the genererally are below
their corresponding main effects/linear terms).  And looking at the
sequential test from the anova function when given only 1 model really
only makes sense reading from the bottom up.

So, if you think in those terms (and I like it staying that way, with a
scrolling computer screen, reading from the bottom up is quicker and
easier), then having the uninteresting intercept at the top of the list
of the coefficients is the best place for it.

Just a couple of thougts,

Would you like to try:

""Life - How Did It Get Here? By Evolution Or By Creation?"" published by
the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, 1985

Yes, this was written by Jehovah's Witnesses.  I realize you may have many
differences with Jehovah's Witnesses, but on this subject you may find
agreement.  This book addresses many of the *theories* that evolutionist
have created, and counters them with Bibical as well as secular evidence
which exposes the evolutionary theory as being impossible.   This
book contains many illustrations and references.  It may be exactly what your 
looking for.

hmmm.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have ""NeoMagic""
you need to have
Driver ""nvidia""

Here is part of my XF86Config

I am using tsls function from sem package to estimate a model which includes large number of data. Among its predictors, it has a nominal data which has about 10 possible values. So I expand this parameter into 9-binary-value predictors with the coefficient of base value equals 0. I also have another continuous predictor. 

The problem is that, whenever I run the tsls, I will get 'System is computationally singular' error all the time. I'm wondering if there is anyway that I can overcome this problem? Please kindly suggest. Thank you so much in advance.

Met with the Team on Friday (713-01) to review the location and possible options for the Duke I/C at WT-1. The concern with the 4"" restriction and the 30 mm they want to flow on Sept. 1, and if we would be able to take it. 

Calculated the pressure drop through the 4"" valve with a worse case option of a 3"" hole that was hot tapped (4"" piping and valves is apx. 18"" in length and rest of I/C is 8"")  and the pressure drop at 30mm is 6 to 7 lbs. Duke has compression on this line and their pressure drop on the 8"" lateral is in the 40 lbs. range to the inlet of WT-1. With the proposed tie-in to the discharge side of the station later, and no more pressure drop that has been calculated on the suction side, we should be able to handle the additional volumes with the current set up. 

There are several options that can take place and we can evaluate once Duke has installed their scrubber. 
1) The existing piping from Duke's I/C is manifolded  with a 4"" to the inlet side of the scrubbers (current gas flow) and a 4"" to the outlet side of the scrubbers (currently closed). Once Duke installs their scrubber and it work satisfactory, the Team can open the 4"" on the outlet side of their scrubbers and have 2 (two) points for gas to flow on the  suction side of WT-1. 
2) If the proposed tie in to the discharge side develops, we can revisit another tie-in point for the suction side at that time and if Dukes scrubber performs satisfactory. With Dukes scrubber in place and in operation, it allows for open access to locations for a tie in, as most of the piping on the pre-scrubbers side at WT-1 is very congested. 

I would recommend that we leave I/C as is for now, if there are concerns or questions, please let me know. 

Thanks

EOG has been non responsive to our request for payment, (go figure).  I would suggest the team physically reduce the flow through the station to 10,000 mmbtu/d, in compliance with TW's operating parameters of requiring monitoring equipment for large volume stations, and continue to restrict the flow until the station complies with our standards.

I have also recently been informed by the TW commercial desk that they have decided to absorb the outstanding expenses to date, and will sponsor the cost for monitoring equipment and commercial power to assure the station complies with our requirements for volumes of this magnitude.  Could you reissue the latest W.O. and indicate that it is not reimbursable, but rather will be a marketing project?  This will clear your outstanding expenses and let us go forward with the station construction.

With regard to my other ""favorite company"" the team and planning are looking at a project to by-pass the 4"" restriction in the WT-1 compressor yard downstream of the new Duke interconnect.  They will be tendering about 30,000 /d the first of September and wont to be sure we be able to take the gas.

Thanks for your help Earl!

What's the latest of the EOG side of this interconnect. They have tied in two more well behind the I/C and did not tell the Team. The Team pulled the plate the other day and it was covered with black b.s., maybe glycol and very hard to clean the plate. 
The location still has the temp. EFM on it (TW's) and no gas quality that was required. 

Is EOG going to pay for the equipment as they stated to get the  I/C in service then back out on?????????????
Is this I/C going to be Shut in??????????????????????????????
It is getting to the critical stage, we have equipment requisitions and some received and lots of $$$$$$$$$$ hanging out. 
What is the next step with EOG??????????????

I know this is your favorite company to deal with and figured you needed some news to cheer you up.

Please let us know how to proceed on this I/C and what Marketing would like to be the next step on this project.

Thanks

Linux being based on Unix incorporates the Unix security model.
The Unix security model EXPECTS hostile code to be run on the
system.  The design is for a multi-user system, and even assuming
that all users are both legitimate AND use the system in good
faith, it assumes that not all programmers are perfect, and
that accidents DO in fact happen.

That's what all of the read/write/execute permissions are
about.

And THAT is what keeps me and my system safe.

The primary threat is the buffer-overflow problem, which was
demonstrated so devastatingly in 1987 by the Morris Worm. We
learned our lessen then about the use of strcat() instead of
strncat(), and other similarly unlimited writes into stack
space (or other memory for that matter).

All of which STILL execute within the chains of R/W/X permissions.
That's WHAT THEY ARE THERE FOR.

You truly don't know what you're talking about.

Go buy AND READ ""The Design of the Unix Operating System""
by Maurice J. Bach.

I paid $80 or so for the 3rd edition in the 1980's.
Used copies of the 4th edition are now available for
the paltry sum of $15 or so.

Featuring: 

Give Me the Simple Life ... But Not Too Simple  
 
The Chinese Entrepreneurial Spirit
 
A Very Attractive Play on Solar Cells 
 
-------------------


Sometimes, when the pace of the modern world gets to be too much, you hear
people talk about how they'd like to scale things back, slow down and get
in touch with a simpler reality.  I've even thought about that myself,
from time to time, although I'm also quite fond of the conveniences of
modern life.  

But that was before the storm last Wednesday that dropped six inches of
wet, Spring snow on southern New Hampshire.  By the time my wife and I
woke up on Thursday morning, our power was out, and our home phone service
was another casualty.   

This isn't all that uncommon here in New England, and in Dover, New
Hampshire where we live, it's usually a matter of a few hours before power
is restored.  But the powers that be didn't get our power back on until 45
hours later, thus giving me the taste of the simpler life that I may have
been yearning for without knowing it.   

When I got home Thursday night, my wife had brought in wood from the
woodshed and had the wood stove in our basement and the fireplace on the
first floor blazing merrily away.  We declined the opportunity to dirty
dishes that we couldn't wash and went out to eat in a part of town that
was still blessedly electrified.  

There followed a picturesque evening with us reading and doing crossword
puzzles by candlelight while sipping tea (since we could still light the
gas range with matches).  All very lovely.  

Friday morning, after 45 minutes of hauling a day's worth of wood from the
woodshed (and noticing the huge fallen pine limbs that illustrated where
the power had gone) and washing my hair with a pitcher of water heated on
the stove, it all seemed a little less idyllic.  I missed my water heater,
my iBook, my electric lights and my steam heat.  This life may be simple,
but I'm not stupid.  

Anyway, given my position as editor of the Cabot China & Emerging Markets
Report, this got me to thinking about people living in mud brick homes out
in the provinces of China who have been living like this for centuries,
without even the running water and flush toilets that have kept the veneer
of civilization intact back home in Dover.  

The communist revolution in China made a huge difference in the lives of
many city dwellers.  But for many peasants, life stayed pretty much the
way it had always been.  Maybe a People's Army medic would be available
and eventually the village might get a TV, but not much else changed.   

Then came the post-Mao era, the unleashing of the Chinese entrepreneurial
spirit and the new Chinese saying ""To get rich is glorious!""  In other
words, The People's Republic of China became the People's [capitalist]
Republic.  And in less than a decade, cell phones, TVs, Internet cafes and
computers began spreading throughout the Middle Kingdom.  

The real lesson here is that while the communist revolution may have been
powerful, the most powerful force in the world is the revolution of rising
expectations.  Once people get a taste of modern life, they like it.  And
once they have it, they usually want more. 

In part, of course, it's the way that magazines, newspapers, movies and
the Internet show you the world of possibilities for the stuff you could
have.  But even more important are the images that modern media give you
about how you could live.  There are more people now living in freedom
because they kicked out their own leaders than there are people who were
freed from their leaders by outside forces.  If the communist party in
China knows what's good for it, it won't make a habit of standing in the
way of the Chinese people's desire to do what they want.  But I don't want
to get into politics.  

To bring this little disquisition around to investing, I'd like to point
out something from an earlier era that I really am nostalgic for ... clean
air.  Many of the best things in the modern world depend on electricity,
and most electricity is generated by burning stuff.  And almost every car
on the road is doing just the same thing.  Steel mills and other
factories, ditto. 

The answer to the riddle about how to have what we love about the modern
world, but without fouling our air, has been out there since the 19th
Century, but it's about to come into its own.  Photovoltaic cells, the
little slabs of doped silicon that power our calculators and keep remote
highway signs alight, are steadily moving toward the tipping point at
which the power that they produce - renewable, non-polluting power - will
rival the cost of power that comes from coal-fired generators. 

On the consumer side, this process is being helped along by countries like
Germany, Italy and Spain, and U.S. states like California that are
offering generous subsidies and rebates to encourage the use of clean
photovoltaic electricity.  And on the manufacturing side, different
manufacturers are using all kinds of strategies to lower costs, including
techniques to make thinner silicon cells, using alternative materials and
streamlining the manufacturing process. 

One of the stocks leading this charge found its way onto the recommended
list of my Report last week.  It's not First Solar, a U.S. manufacturer
we've written about before that's making cells that use less silicon. 
Instead, it's a Chinese solar cell manufacturer that's working on a number
of fronts to get the cost per kilowatt moving toward that long-sought
break-even point.   

The company is called Trina Solar (TSL), and it has the kind of innovative
management that will be needed if the cost per kilowatt is going to keep
heading down.  Consider the company's approach to its silicon feedstock. 
Both the solar cell industry and the semiconductor industry use the same
highly purified silicon as their basic material.  There's a lot of waste
in the process, including broken and contaminated wafers, machining
wastage and the like.  Most companies don't have the capability of
recycling that waste, but Trina Solar does.  And given the persistent
shortage, that's a major advantage.  Trina Solar is also on the way to
being a totally vertically integrated operation, with every step in
manufacturing under the company's direct control on one site.  Some day
there may come a huge breakthrough in the solar industry that will vault
some company into undisputed leadership in the industry and send its stock
into orbit.   But for now, it's Trina Solar and companies like it making
small improvements and finding small advantages that are winning the
battle to get electricity from the sun cheaply enough to make a
difference.

============================

Just by way of contrast, you might want to take a look at Evergreen Solar
(ESLR), an American manufacturer of solar cells that takes a unique
approach to saving silicon.  Evergreen melts its silicon, then runs two
specialized strings through the liquid, creating a film of silicon between
the strings like a flat soap bubble.  The cooled film of silicon can be
used to make very thin solar cells without the wasteful process of sawing
wafers.  ESLR took a big hit when the company lost its supply of silicon,
falling from 17 a year ago to 7 in January, but it has rebounded to near
11 on good contract news, and may have turned the corner.  

By way of contrast with Trina Solar, it's interesting to look at Solarfun
Power Holdings (SOLF), another Chinese solar cell maker.  The company's
stock came public last December and roared from 10 to 17 in just a couple
of months.  But the company issued disappointing projections on gross
margins in early March, and the stock dropped quickly back toward 12.  Our
preference for Trina Solar is only partially based on the company's
technological advantages.  It's also based on the importance that we
attach to positive momentum in a stock's price.  There are lots of
companies whose stock should be going up because of some great patent or
technological edge.  But in the world of aggressive growth investing, we
think there's no substitute for a stock price that indicates that
investors are actually signing on.  So we'll stick with Trina Solar, for
now.  From innovative sources of silicon feedstock to a totally integrated
manufacturing facility, this young company, and its even younger stock,
make for a very attractive play on turning sunlight into electricity and
making the planet happy to boot.

- - - - - miRNAs and Cancer Webinar brought to you by Science - - - - - 
Join us February 20, 2008, at 12 noon Eastern Standard Time (9am PST, 5pm GMT)
for a new webinar discussing miRNAs and Cancer.  The role of miRNAs in human
disease, including cancer, is now well established.  Many questions remain
however, such as precisely how miRNAs exert their effects, whether they make
suitable biomarkers, and how they could be applied therapeutically.  Join our
three expert panelists as they discuss current research on miRNAs important in
tumorigenesis, as well as techniques for miRNA discovery and profiling.
Time is running out!  Register today:  www.sciencemag.org/webinar 
Produced by the AAAS/Science Business Office and sponsored by Stratagene,
an Agilent Technologies company.

I think I now understand your comments. I've used snow and Rmpi quite
a bit. But the problem with Rmpi (or, rather, MPI) is the lack of
fault tolerance: if a node goes down, the whole MPI universe breaks,
and thus the complete set of slaves. Setting up some kind of
fault-tolerant scheme with Rserve seemed possible/simpler (as it does
not depend on the MPI layer).

(Yes, maybe I should check snowFT, but it uses PVM, and I recall a
while back there was a reason why we decided to go with MPI instead of
PVM).

Aha. I should have seen that. I think I understand the differences better now.

Yes, sure. I think that should be doable, though, if I decide to try
to go down this route.

Which means the sender has a list of who the true
targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
my email client distinguishes between messages
that are read, and messages that are not. I like
to mark or save messages that are particularly
interresting or important to me. And even if I
make a point to delete ""suspicious material""
immediately upon reading it, even THAT might
leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.

Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam
protects people who want to distribute or see
material the government disapproves.

Subject:	Internet Advertising agreement

Mark -- I am working with the East power desk to purchase space for an EnronOnline banner ad on a PJM website.  We are buying 7 ads at 500/month/ad for 3 months ($10,500 total).  They are running this ad as a pilot program offered for only 3 months.  I am attaching the agreement they sent to us.  I would like to revise section 2.01 to state that EnronOnline has first right of refusal to keep the ad on their site if they extend the program after three months.  Could you help me revise this agreement?

Thanks

I can have a look at it once it's added to the build.

Btw please do not use raw pixels to specify margin, padding etc. You can
use the sugar/graphics/units.py helpers to do conversion from points. A
little annoying but it ensure stuff looks good both in the emulator and
on the XO.

At some point we want to add support for units to HippoCanvas (and a way
to set the canvas zoom factor) to avoid the extra typing.

It could be me. 

I have a laptop (Compaq LTE/25e, 486, 200meg disk, 12meg mem) that I carried
with me from Sydney to Wisconsin (sabattical leave). I plug it into the 
ethernet here every now and then and mount a file system back in Sydney.
I also took it to the last IETF meeting in Seattle and did the same thing.

I've made a new kernal with SLIP support on a machine in Sydney and copied it 
across. Performance was acceptable but I can't compare it with other systems.

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

follow it up, as thesis work intervened. Both times the
response didn't justify proceeding to a vote. I had a number
of enthusiatic responses via e-mail - but you need 100 more
YES votes than NO votes, and there's a hard core of people who
vote NO to everything that they aren't personally interested.

I didn't want the group to fail, and I don't want to create an

Subject:	HR Organizational Changes


In the past few months, Enron has received numerous requests from other companies to share some of the processes and systems that we have developed within HR.  Also, several new businesses have been created recently by consulting companies to pursue what some financial analysts believe is a huge untapped market in aggregating HR services.  Recently, we completed an internal review to consider what role Enron could play in this arena and have decided to explore some very specific external opportunities.  Due to the time commitment required to pursue these opportunities, we are assigning dedicated resources to this effort.  Effective immediately, the HR community will have three major areas of focus that will be working together in order to optimize HR transformation and commercialization.  Taking the lead roles will be myself, Mary Joyce and David Oxley (see below and attached chart).

�	I will lead this new effort in addition to continuing to lead those areas of HR that are our prime candidates for commercial opportunities.  Reporting to me on this commercialization effort will be:  Brad Coleman with the overall lead; Andrea Yowman who will focus on software applications such as PEP, Expertfinder and Global Compensation; Sarah Davis who will focus on Worklife; Elyse Kalmans who will focus on Community Relations; Cynthia Barrow who will focus on Benefits and Wellness; and Yevgeny Frolov and Dan Brown who will focus on E-learning and Talent Management.  I will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	David Oxley will take the overall lead for HR across all business units focusing on continuing to increase the value HR brings internally to Enron.  The networked recruiting, Organization Development and Training and Business Unit Compensation consulting functions, the Global PEP team, as well as the generalist consulting responsibilities for all Corp. groups, will report directly to David. The HR leads for EWS, EES, EBS, ETS and EGAS will report jointly to their business unit OTC's and to David from a functional HR perspective. In this regard David will now report to Steve Kean.

�	Mary Joyce will add Global Information Management, Corporate Compensation services and Reporting/ Analysis, to her current Executive Compensation responsibilities.  Kathy Schultea, Felecia Acevedo, Cindy Ward and Suzanne Brown will report into Mary's organization. Mary will continue to report to Steve Kean.

�	With Drew Lynch's promotion to COO Metals and David's increased responsibilities, Robert Jones will take the HR lead for EWS Americas. Robert will report to the EWS OTC. Jon Chapman has been appointed head of HR for EEL, based in London, and will report to the EEL OTC. Both Robert and Jon will report to David from a functional HR perspective.

Additional realignment of resources will enable our team to further improve daily employee services, partner with Business Unit initiatives and maximize opportunities for commercialization.  These modifications are as follows:  

�	Scott Gilchrist will lead HR for the newly formed EGAS.  As such he will focus his attention on the asset positions in South America, Latin and Central America, the Middle East and Asia.  The European assets will continue to be a part of EEL.  Scott will also work closely with Rebecca McDonald and Sandip Mallick in relation to our assets in India.  Scott will report to the EGAS OTC, Rebecca McDonald and David as above.

�	Michelle Cash has agreed to take the lead of the Corporate OLER function for an interim period to determine how it should operate and be organized.  She will report to me for this particular function, but of course will remain primarily a part of the EWS legal function reporting to Mark Haedicke.  

�	Sheila Walton will lead the HR Generalist activities for all Corp functions.  Jo Ann Hill, and all of the corporate generalist functions currently under Jo Ann, will report to Sheila Walton.  Sheila will continue to report to David.

�	Sarah Davis will add the Click at Home program to her current responsibilities, and will continue to report to me.

No.  It is just running the terminal software.  The ""file
server"" in this case is just an ordinary user level process
that speaks 9P to the kernel and maintains a file system on
a raw disk partition.  It's slow, and according to the
documentation, susceptible to crashes, although I haven't
had any (yet).

There is no need for a cpu server to run Plan 9, unless you
want to run daemons that accept calls from the outside world,
for instance for mail delivery or remote logins.  There is
no real difference between a terminal and a cpu server; a
cpu server is essentially the same kernel with a different
startup script that starts various daemons.

The file server is a radically different kernel and cannot
coexist on the same machine with the terminal or cpu kernels.
However, you don't need to use the standard file server.

Of course.  However, it is not supported in the system as
distributed; you have to do a bit of work...

also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, ""the more the merrier"". ;-)

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...

Sean Quinlan <sean@CS.Stanford.EDU>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Tue, 01 Mar 1994 19:47:03 -0500",,"
There is a problem with the plan9 memory management system for the PC
due to one of the brain dead features of the 386 architecture.
In particular, the R/W bit in a user page table entry is ignored when
the processor is in supervisor mode.  This means that copy on write will
not work when the kernel is copying into user space.
For example the following code segment exhibits the problem.

#include <u.h>
#include <libc.h>

char    buf[1024];

main()
{
        int i;

        if (fork() == 0) {
                /* make sure memory is allocated RONLY */
                i = buf[0];

                read(0, buf, 1024);
                print(""%s\\n"", buf);
                exits(0);
        }

        /* wait a second so the child completes */

        sleep(1000);

        buf[1023] = 0;

        print(""parent -> %s\\n"", buf);
}

On plan 9 for the pc, the data read into buf will incorrectly appear in both
the child and parent process.

The 486 (and higher?) fixed the problem but to maintain compatibility
it defaults to the 386 behavior.  On a 486 you need to set bit 16 in CR0
to get the correct behavior for the R/W bit.  Of course, if you have a
386, then copy on write can not be fixed, but you can still run plan9
with a copy on reference scheme... unfortunately, this means your 386
machine runs slower and requires more memory...

The complete fix of the problem, thanks to Dave Presotto, follows:

Here's the changes.  It works on a couple of 486's and 386's so its
probably right.

In l.s (around line 131) change

        ORL     $0X80000000,AX
        ANDL    $~(0x8|0x2),AX  /* TS=0, MP=0 */

to

        ORL     $0X80010000,AX
        ANDL    $~(0x40000000|0x20000000|0x8|0x2),AX    /* CD=0, NW=0, TS=0, MP=0 */

This also turns on internal caching in case it was off.

In l.s add the routine

/*
 *  return cpu type (what is a pentium?)
 */
TEXT    x86(SB),$0

        PUSHFL
        MOVL    0(SP),AX
        ORL     $0x40000,AX
        PUSHL   AX
        POPFL
        PUSHFL
        POPL    AX
        ANDL    $0x40000,AX
        JZ      is386
        MOVL    $486,AX
        JMP     done
is386:
        MOVL    $386,AX
done:
        POPFL
        RET

This returns the number 386 or 486 depending.  I guess it'll return
586 also when I get a chance at a Pentium.

In fns.h add a definition for it:

        int     x86(void);

In main.c in confinit() change

        conf.copymode = 0;      /* copy on write */

to

        switch(x86()){
        case 386:
                conf.copymode = 1;      /* copy on reference */
                break;
        default:
        case 486:
                conf.copymode = 0;      /* copy on write */
                break;
        }

Ok, I just got a letter written up and signed, requesting the plan 9
licence and CD-ROM and am sending it to Neera Kuckreja today.
My question is: How long does it take for the licence and CD-ROM 
to show up?
The letter is on the official letterhead, + signed by a faculty member.
Would they need anything else?  Eg, photocopy of Faculty ID or something?

John Fox <jfox@mcmaster.ca>,'John Smith' <ld7631@yahoo.com>,"Mon, 09 Apr 2007 21:46:03 -0400",Re: [R] sem vs. LISREL: sem fails,"Dear Dimitri,

You haven't done anything wrong: Your model is a straightforward
confirmatory factor analysis and it is correctly specified. I suspect that
sem() is picking poor start values.

I can get a solution by specifying two alternative models that are
equivalent to yours:

(1) Rescaling the problem by using correlation-matrix input:

sem.anxiety <- sem(model, KM, N=150)

(2) Fixing the variances of the factors (latent variables) rather than using
reference indicators:

model.2 <- specify.model()
ANXIETY -> a1,      lam_anx_1,  NA
ANXIETY -> a2,      lam_anx_2,  NA
ANXIETY -> a3,      lam_anx_3,  NA
DEPRESS -> d1,      lam_dep_1,  NA
DEPRESS -> d2,      lam_dep_2,  NA
DEPRESS -> d3,      lam_dep_3,  NA
FEAR -> f1,         lam_fear_1, NA
FEAR -> f2,         lam_fear_2, NA
FEAR -> f3,         lam_fear_3, NA
a1 <-> a1,          theta_a1,   NA
a2 <-> a2,          theta_a2,   NA
a3 <-> a3,          theta_a3,   NA
d1 <-> d1,          theta_d1,   NA
d2 <-> d2,          theta_d2,   NA
d3 <-> d3,          theta_d3,   NA
f1 <-> f1,          theta_f1,   NA
f2 <-> f2,          theta_f2,   NA
f3 <-> f3,          theta_f3,   NA
ANXIETY <-> ANXIETY,NA,         1
DEPRESS <-> DEPRESS,NA,         1
FEAR <-> FEAR,      NA,         1
ANXIETY <-> FEAR,   phi_AF,     NA
ANXIETY <-> DEPRESS,phi_AD,     NA
DEPRESS <-> FEAR,   phi_DF,     NA

# Running the estimation using sem:
sem.anxiety.2 <- sem(model.2, COVAR, N=150)


A couple of small points unrelated to the problem you experienced: (1) You
didn't need to load the MASS package, since you didn't appear to use
anything in it; (2) comments in R are prefixed by #, not !.

I hope this helps,
 John

Michelle,
 
I called the Brookside Country Club today to see if they would rent you
a set of clubs.  Unfortunately, they do not have clubs to rent out. 
They suggested, if possible, you borrow a set from a friend.  
 
I'm not sure if renting from a friend is possible, but I do have a set
of clubs you could borrow.  They aren't the fanciest and they are
starting to show their age, but I would be glad to let you borrow them. 
Please give me a call if you are interested and I will bring them to the
golf outing.

guenther@stolaf.edu,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Sun, 01 May 1994 02:29:51 -0400",assorted questions,"
We've been trying to get plan9 setup in some form here at St Olaf for
awhile now, and I've finally got it to the point were I could go
through and recompile the kernels, fix the permissions on /adm, etc.
Throughout this I've been aquiring a list of questions/problems.
Well, yesterday when I fired up the cpu server and terminal (both Sun
SLC's that run SunOS normally.  Dang machine shortage.) into plan9, I
couldn't use the cpu command to get from the terminal to the cpu server,
so I figured I might as well flush my list and see if I'm totally confused.

Setup
------
fileserver: ""the_ruler"" SPARCstation 2 with 1G drive
cpu server: ""tanna"" SPARCstation SLC, diskless (also serves authentication)
terminal:   ""eros""  same as cpu server

The fileserver + drive are our spares, so I've backing up my changes via
u9fs. :-|  The cpu server and terminal are in the CS lab, and run SunOS
normally.  When I want to work with plan9 I halt them and use the boot
rom's ""dload"" command to snarf the proper kernel via tftp (saves having
to change the ether's database or /tftpboot on the server).  Thus they
can't run plan9 continuously (just not enough computer to spare right
now).

Okay, here's the list.  Most of these have implict ""why?"" or ""anybody
see this?"" attached.

1)	The fileserver is supposed to rerequest the password when
you type control-D on it's console.  I do that, and it halts.  I've
added a new command ""exit"" which just calls conslock() to get around
this, but I'm not sure why it doesn't work correctly.

2)	Every so often, the filesever will just stop accepting connections.
You can see the allocation message, but the remote machine never gets a
nop, auth or attach through apparently.  This appears to have some
connection with ethernet errors (from statl).  Rebooting the fileserver
fixes the problem.

3)	Speaking of rebooting the fileserver, whenever I do so I have to
reenter all the info.  Why?  If I don't, the ip address is incorrect!  I
can type:
	service the_ruler.plan9.stolaf.edu
	ip 130.71.8.48
	ipgw 130.71.8.1
	ipmask 255.255.255.0
	ipauth 0.0.0.0
	config w1
	filsys main w1
and it works fine.  I halt it, reboot, not enter config mode, but watch
the config messages go by, and the ip address becomes something like
135.104.9.122.  Everything else is fine (ipgw, service, etc).

4)	DNS.  Does *anybody* know how to get plan9 to use DNS?  I've added
ns lines to /lib/ndb/local, both for the DNS root as well as stolaf.edu.

dom=stolaf.edu
        ns=nic.stolaf.edu
        ns=mari.acc.stolaf.edu
        ns=news.stolaf.edu
dom=nic.stolaf.edu ip=130.71.128.8
dom=mari.acc.stolaf.edu ip=130.71.192.16
dom=news.stolaf.edu ip=130.71.128.9

And our cpu server starts ""ndb/dns -s"" from /bin/cpurc.  Sure enough,
I can point nslookup at the cpuserver and it does proper forwarding.
How can I get cs to use it?  ""echo 'add dns' >/net/cs""?  I looked at
the dns and cs source, but got lost very quickly.

5)	BOOTP.  Due to the difficulties of getting authentication running
without machines getting their info from BOOTP (as opposed to just typing
it in each time), I hacked the plan9 kernel to do roughly rfc1048 & 1533
BOOTP.  That is, the vendor field turns into options with the rfc specified
magic cookie (99.130.83.99), it extracts the fields to do ipmask and ipgw,
and options 209, 210 and 211 are site-specific options to specify
fileserver, authentication server, and ip number.  ip number?  Yeah.  Since
these machines run SunOS normally, the ip number in the BOOTP header goes
with the name under SunOS, and this other BOOTP option gives their plan9
IP.  Feel free to vomit.  Anyway, is there someway this can be shared with
any interested parties?  Do I have to see a copy of their plan9 license
before I can email them diffs to 9/boot/ip.c and 9/port/bootp.h?

6)	Okay, now the biggy: authentication.  First of all, the
documentation isn't at all clear on what actually have to be in the
keys database to make it work.  Reading the source of libauth yielded
the following as far as I can tell undocumented fact:

	Each cpu server needs to entered as a host in the plan9 auth
	database with the machine password under the system's name.

The installation guide mentions machine login's, but doesn't say how to
make them (that's easy), what they're for, or that cpu server ""tanna""
needs auth entry ""tanna"".  This is after 3 hours of tracing libauth when
I just had a host entry for ""bootes"" (still haven't changed that).
Anyway, I got it working.

Yesterday, I fired up plan9 again.  Ha.  cpu decided it doesn't like me,
and proceeds to return ""challenge mismatch"".  Okay, maybe a password was
incorrectly entered somehow.  So I reenter the machine password in the
auth database for both bootes and tanna (the cpu/auth server's name).
Bzzt.  I reenter mine.  Still no go.  I remove /adm/keys from the file
server console, recreate it, and restock it with users.  Still no go.
Worked fine a week ago.  Maybe it's because the moon is now waning...

So this last one is really a plea to someone in the know to explain
the practicals of setting up authentication under plan9.  I've read
the manpages too much.  How do the commands reflect the theory in
auth(6)?

Much preresponse appreciation.

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 

The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 

Speaking in tongues 

""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 

 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 

""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. 

The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 

The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. 

Slow system 

For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 

The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 

""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 

The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 

But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

Did this user actually authenticate? All indications are that he or she
did not. Just because the server allows authentication, does not mean
that all users correctly configure their mail clients to use it.

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

More information on SSS can be found on ftp.chorus.fr, look among their 
index for references to implementing Chorus on the ipsc/386 and the 
T9000, and on loosely coupled multiprocessors.  The papers are:

UNIX on a Loosely Coupled Architecture: The Chorus/MiX Approach
	(CS/TR-91-49)
Chorus/MiX, A Distributed UNIX, on Multicomputers
	(CS/TR-92-10)

Andy ""what have we learnt"" Tanenbaum has also done work in this area 
with the Amoeba Operating system (I don't have the papers handy, but here 
is a reference)
	Tannenbaum - Andrew Tanenbaum, Rob van Renese, and Hans van 
Staveren. {\\it A Retrospective and Evaluation of the Amoeba Distributed 
Operating System}, Techical Report, Vrije University, Amsterdam, October, 
1989, pp. 27.

Another good paper is:
	Hildebrand - Dan Hildebrand. {\\it An Architectural Overview of 
QNX.} The proceedings of the Usenix Workshop on Micro--Kernels \\& Other 
Kernel Architectures, Seattle, April, 1992.

This, and some amoeba papers, are also available for anon ftp on 
ftp.cse.ucsc.edu under pub/qnx and pub/amoeba.

More info can by found by doing an archie search on amoeba.
Basically all it boils down to is (a gross oversimplification) making 
loosely coupled non shared memory processors (possibly several single 
board computers in a VME chassis) feel like a single computer.  This does 
seem to be a good way to go, shared memory multiprocessors tend to run 
out of memory to processor bandwidth.  I am not sure if Plan 9 can do 
SSS, perhaps someone can correct me if I am wrong.

This seems *way* too high. If there have been only 20 messages total in
that folder, sa-learn should have processed these in a few *seconds* or
less.

What did you expect? Based on your numbers above, processing that folder
would have taken 10-20 *hours*...

Hmm. Kmail doesn't start one process per mail by any chance?

Dunno if there are limitations -- however, your 7k messages should be
perfectly fine. Just ran a test on a 6k messages mbox file, and there
was no noticeable difference to a 30 messages test.

stetler@mail.wsu.edu,Multiple recipients of list <wind_erosion@unicorn.acs.ttu.edu>,"Thu, 15 Dec 1994 14:15:33 -0600",Introduction & Research Interests,"Hello from the snowy northwest

I have just signed on the wind erosion discussion list and would like to 
introduce myself.

I am a research scientists working out of the Dept. of Biological Systems 
Engineering, Washington State University. My duties are directly geared to 
the USDA/ARS and US EPAs ' Columbia Plateau PM10/Wind Erosion Project'. This 
project involves several faculty of WSU, ARS scientists, U of Idaho faculty, 
and various segments of Ag coperative research. Our mission is to measure 
wind erosion and simultaneous PM10 emissions from agricultural fields on the 
Columbia Plateau and to model dust emission and transportation across the 
region. Products will be displayed in GIS format where high emission areas 
will be able to be identified.

My primary responsibilities involve field-scale measurements of wind 
erosion, PM10, and met data. To do this, we currently maintain 3 sites 
across the Plateau that consist of a full met station (5 wind speeds, 3 
temps, radiation, wind direction, etc.), 8 low-vol PM10 samplers (at 4 
heights over 3 towers), 2 high-vol PM10 samplers (Anderson), and 12 poles 
each with 5 dust samplers. All data are collected on a data logger, which 
also controls the equipment when an erosion event is occurring. 

I also am in charge of using our new portable wind tunnel to measure erosion 
and dust emissions. This tunnel (designed & built in Pullman) is used to 
gather erosion/emission data across the entire study area on as many soil 
types and field conditions as possible. Initial field use of the tunnel took 
place last August and results are promising.

The ultimate goal of my research is to develop an emission model for PM10 
that will be fed into the erosion/transport model for dispersion.

I am a geologist specializing in sedimentology and eolian mechanics. I also 
have done alot of work on climatic-eolian interactions on the Hanford Site. 
GIS has shown itself to be a critical component of this type of work. I am 
interested in hearing from anyone doing similar research utilizing GIS and 
climatic-eolian factors.

I am also interested in wind tunnel designs, high resolution data of 
coherent structures, roughness effects on such structures, and grain 
entrainment. Anyone out there?

Been trying to build the ICON
distribution from arizona state on NS 3.3 Intel.
If anyone could help I would appreciate it.
The following output is from the attempt.
I copied the next config directory, and put
the i386_linux rswitch.c into it to replace
the m68k rswitch code.  Was told this should
work, but i get the following.  Please
respond to me via email since this is not
too much of a public issue to discuss.

Happy New Year!

Todd

PS.  Got the distribution twice to make sure it
was not corrupted.  Also tried the rswitch.c from
i486_linux also.

you can, all you need for programming are those little micro-code 
instructions... 
The question should be made clear: which programming constructs provide 
better tools for us to use? 

Icon is a good language since it give you some important tools that help 
you work (goal directed evaluation, generators, lists, tables etc...) It 
is important to rank the different tools by how useful they are. And I am 
sorry to conclude that since people here say they rarely use it, 
backtracking doesn't seem to be a very popular or useful tool.

I just want to emphesize that this is all part of the larger picture- 
that is what language you use and what it offers. In prolog, for example, 
bakctracking is of the essential... 
Perhapse in Icon we don't need it so much. What do we use instead? 
Lazy-lists? supension? Is this choice of other tools justified?

Everything is fluid at the moment as the Argy conf. call at 9 this morning did not have its intended effect in the markets.  We will update as we get further reports.

Robert Johnston 713.853.9934


Here's what we know:

INSIDE ARGENTINA
Cavallo is at the edge, very reliably reportedly asking for more power from De La Rua or else.  Markets are already rife with resignation rumors
Domestic political opposition to deficit cut plan is general in Argentina - both in coalition and among opposition, particularly federal v. provincial leaders.  Implementing past cuts still incomplete and willingness to take further local, domestic pain for international markets is very weak.
Efforts afoot to try and swap out of short-term Letes (91-day) debt into 1 year, but current conditions (200%+ overnight rates) make it all but impossible

USTreasury, IMF
There is no sign of any willingness, either at the IMF or Treasury, to do anything for Argentina.  Recent events have only confirmed O'Neill's bias against bail-out - he believes it will only be a temporary save and that current problems will be constantly revisited going forward
USTreasury briefed Fed yesterday on strategy and the bottom line is that Brazil is seen as the best place to make a stand.  There are three arguments behind this: 
	- First, there is nothing that can reliably save Argy at this point and it is better to husband resources and credibility for use elsewhere if Argy blows-up; 
	- Second, there are reasons to support Brazil, both for itself and for international contagion concerns: defending Brazil is the best way to quarantine 	  Argy effects; Brazil has problems internally, but they are seen a more likely to be solved than in Argy aid that they have been exacerbated by Argy;  
	- Third, defending Brazil is seen as first line defense of Mexico, which is seen as necessary to defend for domestic US political and economic reasons, apart 	  from the additional international concerns.

At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3

to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

I presume you are using the function map() from the maps package.
?map says that it returns a list with x, y, range, and names
components.
You could do something like following, for example (UNTESTED).

  state.borders.ll<-map(""state"",plot=FALSE)
  state.borders<-project(cbind(state.borders.ll$x,state.borders.ll$y),proj=""+proj=lcc +lat_1=48 +lat_2=33 +lon_0=-100"")
  lines(state.borders)

TONIGHT ON THE CBS EVENING NEWS
 

Here is an early preview of what we are planning for tonight's CBS
EVENING NEWS from Anchor and Managing Editor, Katie Couric... 

Hi, everyone, 

Tens of thousands draped themselves in Iraqi flags and marched through
the streets of two Shiite holy cities today to mark the fourth
anniversary of Baghdad's fall to U.S. troops. The show of force was
orchestrated by the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, who proved
that he commands an enormous following among Iraq's largest religious
group. Martin Seemungal is in Baghdad, and will have more on this story
tonight. 

Iran announced a dramatic expansion of uranium enrichment, saying it has
begun operating 3,000 centrifuges. That's nearly 10 times the previously
known number, and is in defiance of U.N. demands that it halt the
program or face increased sanctions. We will have a reality check on the
real threat from Iran. 

President Bush is making another push for immigration reform. He visited
the U.S.-Mexico border to tout a guest worker program for immigrants.
With up to 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., lawmakers haven't
agreed on how to uphold the law without disrupting lives, eroding the
work force and risking political upheaval. Kelly Cobiella will report
from the desert stretch where Arizona and Mexico meet. Border agents
there say they are pelted with rocks and the victims of assault from
smugglers. In fact, there have been more assaults against agents in the
Yuma sector this year than all of last year. 

At any one time in this country, as many as 100,000 people are suffering
from heart failure, but only about 2,000 people a year receive heart
transplants. For a long time, doctors were focused on developing a heart
pump as a bridge to when a new heart becomes available. But a new device
is showing it can be more than just a bridge. Our contributing medical
correspondent, CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta, will tell you about this. 

There's also a growing uproar over radio host Don Imus' racially charged
comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team. Despite
his on-air apologies, the calls continue for him to be fired from his
syndicated morning program, after his racially charged comments. Imus
appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton's radio program today and issued
another apology. Richard Schlesinger will have this report, and will
discuss the FCC's regulations as well. 

Finally, for computer researcher Zombie Bell even his morning walk to
work is part of a grand experiment in digitizing and remembering
everything. The little camera around his neck takes a picture every 30
seconds or so, and a sound recorder rolls non-stop. Bell is saving his
whole life on computer, from childhood certificates to all his medical
records. John Blackstone will have his story. 

I hope to see you tonight. Katie

TUESDAY MORNING ON THE EARLY SHOW
 

Harry Smith, Hannah Storm, Julie Chen, and Russ Mitchell anchor THE
EARLY SHOW from New York. Dave Price will bring us the weather. 

Along with the top news of the day, we will also have the following
stories: 

ANNA NICOLE'S SISTER: NEW BOOK, PT. 1: In the first of an exclusive
two-part interview, Donna Hogan, sister of Anna Nicole Smith, will join
us to talk about the death of the blonde bombshell. Tuesday morning, in
her first interview since her sister's death, Hogan will join us to
discuss her unauthorized biography of the late actress entitled, Train
Wreck: The Life and Death of Anna Nicole Smith. 

LOU DOBBS: In the first of his new weekly commentaries, Lou Dobbs,
anchor and managing editor of CNN's Lou Dobbs Tonight, will join us. 

TWO HEROES who have made a difference: In another installment of our
special series, Second Act, we will take a look at Jim Laws, a
cardiologist from Ohio, and Ed Artis, who began his career as a juvenile
car thief. Ed soon found himself in the Army, where he learned to get
things done in hostile places. It was not long after that he began his
life as a freelance humanitarian. When Ed met Jim in Moscow in 1993, the
two knew they were destined for great things. In Moscow, Ed became a
Knight of Malta, a humanitarian order that dates back to the Crusades.
Jim, already a Knight for his Community Service, became intrigued by
Ed's courage. The two formed Knightsbridge and raise money like any
charity, but their ability to distribute large quantities of aid and
medicine directly to the people at the end of the line is what sets them
apart. Ed Artis and Jim Laws have risked their lives distributing tens
of millions of dollars worth of aid to the needy, and they couldn't be
happier. We'll hear their amazing story Tuesday morning.

humanitarian mission to Darfur, go to:

simple tricks. Tuesday morning, Cook's Illustrated founder and editor
Chris Kimball will join us with recipes from the exciting new make-ahead
recipe cookbook - a must for any cook concerned with time. 

HOW SAFE IS YOUR DRINKING WATER?: A new study to be released on Tuesday
takes a look at the quality of drinking water across the country. How
safe is your drinking water? The results may surprise you. CBS News
Transportation and Consumer Safety Correspondent Nancy Cordes will join
us with more. She'll also shed some light on the best filtration
products that are available. 

MARTIN SHORT: On Tuesday, the original cast recording of Martin Short:
Fame Becomes Me, will be released. Joining us to celebrate the release
of his album will be the very funny Martin Short! 

CONSUMER REPORTS: BEST AND WORST APPLIANCES: Well it turns out that
paying more for your kitchen appliances does not guarantee reliability.
The Consumer Reports Annual Product Reliability Survey identifies the
most and least reliable product brands and the results just may surprise
you. Tuesday morning, we'll take a look at how some of the more popular
kitchen ranges, refrigerators, dishwashers and microwaves fared in the
recent survey. Mandy Walker, Senior Editor of Consumer Reports, will
join us with a roundup of the latest. 

SHIA LEBEOUF ON DISTURBIA: Actor Shia LaBeouf is one of Hollywood's
hottest rising stars. He first gained attention at age thirteen with his
Emmy winning role on the Disney series Even Stevens. He parlayed that
into a successful film career with a starring role in Holes, and was
soon teaming up with A-listers like Will Smith in I, Robot and Keanu
Reeves in Constantine. Now, LaBeouf has three films being released in
the next three months, including Disturbia, which opens this Friday. The
rising star will join us Tuesday morning to talk about his new film and
newfound success. 

FURNITURE AND TAXES: With tax season upon us, many of us are looking for
an easy way to reduce some of our out-of-pocket costs. Jennifer Litwin,
author of Furniture Hot Spots and Best Furniture Buying Tips Ever!, and
a contributor to Consumer's Digest magazine, recommends donating gently
used furniture to save money on income taxes. So how can you decide what
items will make the most sizable contributions? Jennifer Litwin will
join us with advice.

Agreed. I rotate learning mailboxes to historical names monthly.

In other words, everybody has SpamAssassin-SPAM and SpamAssassin-HAM mail 
folders that sa-learn processes nightly, then on the first of the month 
those get moved to somthing like SpamAssassin-x-YYYYMM.

In addition, the script that launches sa-learn only tells it about 
learning folders that have been modified in the last three days.

>I've been asked to lead an evening Bible Study a week from tonight on

For a good historical perspective of the modern creationist movement
I would recommend:  _The Creationists_
                    by Ronald L. Numbers
                    New York : A. A. Knopf, 1992.

This book skips the scientific debate of creation vs. evolution and
instead details the history of various Christian creationist movements
and creationist organizations starting from around 1900.  Very interesting
and, because it avoids the scientific debate, largely unbiased (read
Ronald Number's introduction for more details).  Most of the information
is based on first-hand accounts and interviews.

Tim Ikeda

I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious ""David 
Blaine: Stalag Magician"".  The ego'd one is in a WWII prison camp and sort of 
trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british 
officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a 
freezer.  At one point he's asked why and says ""Well it's not for publicity"" 
Cracking stuff.

Attached is a note that has been sent to our managers regarding off-site and team-building meetings.  My impression is that our commendable efforts to build transatlantic synergies are resulting in too many get-togethers that require substantial travel.  Our challenge is that such gatherings are far more costly and time-consuming for us to attend than our Houston colleagues might realize.  Often, participating in these meetings takes an entire week for Enron Europe employees (especially if they are outside of Texas). Naturally, they may feel that this time of year (PRC time) is exactly the wrong time from a career perspective to miss this kind of gathering.

These off-sites are sometimes scheduled at the end of a quarter, which compounds the difficulty; worse still are the times they occur at the end of Q2, since it also coincides and conflicts with the PRC process.

I would appreciate your efforts to remind your managers to consider the travel time and costs (both direct and indirect) when inviting international employees to off-site meetings in the US.  We appreciate the chance to be included in the broader Enron initiatives and to share ideas across organizations, but we are really trying to reinforce the message about managing expenses.

Thanks!

John Sherriff


(Letter sent to all Enron Europe VPs and direct reports)

We still have issues regarding Offsites and 'Team Building' exercises.  In particular, we have recently had examples of departments failing to inform other key work groups when workplace absences are pending.

In order to avoid misunderstandings, and to increase transparency, the following will apply with immediate effect:

Any Offsite or 'Team Building' exercise which any group (both commercial and non-commercial, and including John and myself)intends to undertake must be communicated, in advance, to all department heads. Issue to be identified include:  all participants who will out of the office, total costs of the exercise; and, where appropriate, work load coverage details.

John and I are very supportive of team building exercises but we much prefer that they be conducted in the evenings or at weekends. To the extent that is not possible, we must absolutely avoid quarter ends and ensure all work is appropriately covered.

Trips to Houston and especially resorts in the US are far more difficult to justify based on the substantial travel time and costs involved.  So please pay particular attention to optimising our transatlantic travel.

Please communicate this policy to your staff.

Michael Brown

Go on. Tell them how long the /first/ one lasted.

I vote external firewire if the laptop has the ports for it.

 From Discovery to Delivery: The Impact of University/Biotech Licensing
Agreements on Access to Medicines in the Developing World

MONDAY, APRIL 9, 2007, 6:30 p.m., Pound Hall 335, Harvard Law School
(hors d'oeuvres and refreshments at 6:15)

Each year, 10 million people die because they did not have access to
existing medicines. The high price of patented medicines is a major
contributor to this problem, especially the developing world. 
Universities, dedicated to the public good, research and patent many of
the most needed medicines but license their patent rights in exchange
for royalties to pharmaceutical companies that develop drugs and block
access to low-cost generic alternatives in the developing world.  Join
noted scientists, university administrators, IP lawyers and public
health experts in a discussion of how university licensing practices
can be changed to promote greater global access to
university-researched medicine.

A panel discussion featuring:
  • Isaac Kohlberg, Associate Provost & Chief Technology Development
Officer, Harvard University
  • Amy Kapczynski, Intellectual Property Attorney, Founder of
Universities Allied for Essential Medicines
  • William Rodriguez, Associate Director of International Operational
Research at the Harvard Medical School Division of AIDS
  • Liza Vertinsky, Associate, Wolf Greenfield & Sachs P.C.
  Moderated by:
  • Talha Syed, Fellow, Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy,
Biotechnology, and Bioethics

Sponsored by
Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy
Biotechnology, and Bioethics in collaboration with Ethics, Law and
Biotechnology (ELaB)

Medicines (UAEM)

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

like someone has owned their server and having a bit of fun, because the 
server is literally announcing itself as ""Spam-Server"" in the HELO 
instead of the FQDN!

For example, I dare you to redistribute one of Adobe's Type I

Consequently, the interesting questions regarding the Plan 9
fonts are:

(1) How did Bell Labs derive the bitmap data?  If they digitized
    the fonts themselves from, say, blown up photographs, they
    are on safe legal ground.  Likewise if they constructed the
    fonts by hand with a bitmap editor.  (Given that these fonts
    look awfully reminescent of the ""blit"" fonts, I suspect that
    they date to the early 1980's and were constructed by hand.)

(2) How does Bell Labs feel about us using their bitmap data

My comments...

Alias Tables:
Vish is making some changes to Table Edit.  As soon as he is done I will demo it for you.  Showing the counterparty name rather than the code is no problem.

Routing Errors:
Asem is looking into the ""Term Code"" errors.

Path Confimation:
1.  To alleviate some of the time issues, we will attempt to log all errors on a record rather than only the first error.  Also, we will be trying to find the bottleneck in the confirm process.

2.  Asem is looking into the ""Variant Conversion"" errors.

3.A.  I believe the full path is being displayed, but you are not able to see it because the column needs to be sized larger.  I will have Vish auto-size that column

3.B.  Vish is working on this.

3.C.  Vish is working on this.

Subject:	Testing PreSchedule Workspace-June20

Good Afternoon;

I have spent the last 3 1/2 hours working in the preschedule workspace dealing with June 20th, delivery points West Wing, Mead 230, Craig, Four Corners 345, Midway-PSC. These are small points that are complicated and use transmission for the paths.  Here is the completed PSW sheet for your analysis.

 << File: Rockies_June_20.psc >> 


What worked:

Routing worked at Midway, which was a shaped hourly schedule, expressed as a shaped hourly schedule on the sheet. Craig routed, and So did Four Corners. 

Path Confirmation: still took over an hour to run,  but data is populated in the system now.  Please see my notes below for what did not work. From my preliminary view, the data appears to be correct, but I am going to leave final determination of the usability of this format for the decision of Bill Williams III and our real time group.  I was able to do some sorting and things look really good. The speed of the sort and pulling up batch info looks great.



What did not work:


Routing: West Wing and Mead did not route,  I got errors on 46 rows ""Error: Invalid Routing Term Code"".  The Term Column says DAY.  Does this error message reflect some other error?

Alias Tables: We seem to have a major disconnect between our original intention and what is going on here.  The original intention  is that if the scheduler sheet says ""PINW"" instead of ""PINNACLEWE"", the program will understand that and populate all schedules with PINW in  the proper counterparty of Pinnacle West in the Confirm View.  Right now, the sheet is omitting the paths without the ENPOWER long name, and using the aliases as counterparty names in the Path Confirmation VIEW.  The Path Confirmation View should give the Long Name that we see in Table Edit Field ""Counterparty"". The Alias list is to help schedulers not have to use really long and cryptic acronyms when dealing with multiple paths.  Please call me so that we can talk about this ,  it seems like we are totally not understanding each other here.

Path Confirmation: 
	1.Each time I ran my confirmation button, it took an hour, I would find an error, and run it again, it took another hour, I would see another error, and it took another 	hour.  3 hours to run one little sheet is no good. 

	2. Path confirmation also omitted 4 schedules with the error of ""Invalid Variant Type Conversion"".  The common thread in all of these paths is that they are 	generated at one point, and have transmission deals, and end up at a different point.  All transmission deals are entered properly in the sheet. These are lines 12-14 	and line 35 in the attached sheet.

	3. The data that has populated into the Confirmation system has problems.  

		A.  For each Counterparty,  we need to see the ENTIRE path.  Not just what is in the portion that the marketer has above or below them.

		B. The confirming of each path must be able to be done quickly.  Double clicking the path, waiting two minutes and then populating a name is too long. 		Currently in Lotus, the operator holds down the shift key, and mouse clicks on each path that is confirmed with the counterparty.  This puts a check by 		each line. The operator then clicks ""Confirm"" and the dialog box with the time stamp and field for name appears.  When the name is populated and the 		operator clicks ""OK""  each path is confirmed as a batch.

		C. The name that appears when I look up ""Party"" should be the long name that appears in the table edit field ""Counterparty"".  The phone number should 		also populate on that line, as well as the check box if it is checked. This is consistent with what we have now. The name that appears now is the Enpower 		short name or the alias.

	
Other functions will be evaluated tomorrow.  I have a meeting for the remainder of the day, but will be available tomorrow for some testing.  I have committments until 9 am or so.

Another possibility would be to compute the minimized DFAs, then
compute the minimized DFA of the union.  If it's the same as either
of the originals, you've got a match.

Hard to say which method would be quicker.  Since they're essentially
duals of each other, I wouldn't be surprised if it was a wash.

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

Why do you say Dell is cheaper than DNUK?

Also, at least one ""book using the ISwR package"" has information on the

I'd consider it an error.

I think a proto cannot be expected to work retroactively.  In fact, I
think it's probably an error to declare a proto after a non-proto in the
same scope.

I believe ""veto"" is giving the wrong idea here as something that
happens after the fact.  What's the term for only allowing ""acceptable""
candidates to put their names on the ballot?  Anyway, as TSa surmises,
the ballot is vetted or stacked in advance--only those candidates
that *could* bind are considered to be part of the candidate set.
In the abstract, candidates that cannot match never get their names
on the ballot, though of course an implementation might choose to
determine this lazily as long as it preserves the same semantics.

Alternately, even if the list of valid candidates is determined
eagerly, if the candidate list construction is memoized based on the
typeshape of the Capture, it will generally not have to be redone
until you see a different typeshape (where the meaning of ""different""
may depend on how specific the signatures are, and in particular on
whether any of the signatures rely on subset constraints (including
individual values, which are just degenerate subsets)).

we went through this here some time ago with an implementation of
the smtp part of upas as mangled by System V.4 and
somewhat unmangled by me.  it seems to be sufficient
to have the smtpd pick the right name to put in the Unix
`From ' header.  since it has already cracked the header and knows RFC822,
it's a fairly simple change.  it takes the `From ' address from the first of
Reply-to:, From:, Sender: and SMTP FROM:.  errors go to the SMTP FROM:.
(there should never be a Sender: without a From: but we get junk mail
from some machines.)

the Reply command in the mail reader just uses the `From ' address,
and needn't mess with the Wilt . (the Stilt) crud unless it wants to.

i didn't understand the recent discussion
until i realised that my From lines were being built as described by
our Unix machine before being sent to me on Plan 9,
and that's why my replies were going to the right address.

If we don't assign the ENA Master, the confirm will need to be a GTC Dedicated Reserves confirmation.

The question is, do we need to revise the Master to ENA Upstream too  -  John ?

You will get a license form back from AT&T. Your lawyers have to agree
to it & someone appropriate in your university will have to sign it.
It took ~ 7 months here before things were settled. *After* that, you
get the cd & doc pretty quickly.

I confirmed that since Enron does not deviate from their schedules in real
time a good portion of the payments have been going to Enron.  It is still
up in the air what they will do with these charges.

And will run Solaris 9 when Sun catch up with the x86 drivers and kernel.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.

(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told
three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)

FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no
longer see any specific reason why one is better than the other. Expect Red
Hat Solaris 11 any time now... <grin>

Thank you very much ! Your sample code is very helpful.

In linear separable problem, I should use fda by linear regression
instead of bruto unless taking some dimensional reduction process,  
should I?

Cheers.

Actually, my schedule is such that I usually don't read it UNTIL the

doesn't hurt.

Could you post an example of this?  I'm very curious to see what it is you
are doing.  I would also like to see what type of ""forall"" predicates you
want to implement.

Thanks.

Icarus Sparry <I.Sparry@ss1.bath.ac.uk>,plan9-fans@cse.psu.edu,"Mon, 05 Jul 1993 06:06:20 -0400",sfio vs bio,"David Korn and Kiem-Phong Vo have just released a new version of sfio,
the 'Safe Fast I/O' package, which is designed as a replacement for
stdio.

The paper 'How to use the Plan 9 C Compiler' tells us ""Bio is a small
and very efficient, particularly for buffer-at-a-time or line-at-a-time
I/O. Even for character-at-a-time I/O, however, it is significantly
faster than the Standard I/O library""

Before I do it, has anyone else measured these two on similar hardware
(e.g.  Sun Sparc-Station 2, running SunOS)? The paper with sfio gives
some figures for Andrew Humes FIO package and some existing stdio
packages.

Sfio has more facilities, e.g. you can define error handlers for
streams, and can make use of operating system facilities like memory
mapped files.

The equivalent of ^C is delete.  (Long ago, Delete was
the standard interrupt character on Unix too, but
Berkeley, in their infinite wisdom, decided to switch

To be sure.  If you create a new DFA, L(E1) or L(E2), then the if you
remove extra states correctly you should end up with the same DFA when
your done if in fact L(E1) is a subset of L(E2).  So in many computa-
tional contexts, the question of whether one is a subset or not is not
important.  Put more succinctly, the regexp a|a* is going to result in
the same DFA as a*, if done ""by the book.""

The cygwin implementation of rename goes like this:

1) Try to use MoveFile
2) Try to use MoveFileEx(..., MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)
3) Try to unlink destination, then try to use MoveFile

And as you say, Cygwin claims it meets POSIX.1. And, POSIX.1 says, ""If 
newpath already exists it will be atomically replaced (subject to
a few conditions; see ERRORS below), so that there is no point at which 
another process attempting to access newpath will find it missing."" 
Clearly, unliking and then calling MoveFile is not atomic. So, cygwin is 
not being honest here because in these less frequent cases, the rename 
will not be atomic.

Also note, MVCRT only tries step 1 of cygwin's version. Which I believe 
also suggests that it's the only version that is atomic.

geoff@plan9.cs.su.oz.au,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Tue, 08 Feb 1994 11:57:05 -0500",ping... ping... ping...,"Some survey-type questions for non-Bell p9 sites...

Out there, who is actually gotten p9 running? (that is, you've
got a distribution and you've installed it and gotten a
usable system up and running)

Of those, how many still have their Plan 9 partition/machine?

Of those, how many log onto it regularly, or use it as their 
system of choice?

How about configurations - who is using what? SPARCS? x86's?
Dedicated file servers? WORM drives?

If a Plan 9 archive site opened, would you want to use 9P
to talk to it, or FTP? What would you want to upload? What
would you want to see there?

How many people at your site use Plan 9? How many
develop or do research on it? What are they doing?

Of particular interest would be development work - I think
we should have a better idea of what the rest of the world
is doing, to avoid messy duplication.

Post your answers or mail them to me, and I'll strip out
locations/identities if you don't want to publish to the
world that you're running a system that
1) has a user `none' that can be accessed from anywhere, and
2) can listen to a Ethernet promiscuously
Oops - that just slipped out. I'm not trying to give bozos
ideas (you can't telnet in as none from outside our department
anyway) but some better way of controlling access to the
`none' account better be dreamed up (not everyone has the
luxury of a firewalled system). Grumph.

Another random question while I'm on - are there any good,
high-speed point-to-point interfaces to hook up PC's at a
fairly short distance (say 0.5m)? It strikes me that most
networks are overkill for linking a file server and cpu
server, given that they are designed for many hosts and
fairly large distances. Neither of these factors apply to
a cpu/fs link. A cheap solution to the above would be
appreciated.

This is doing a single 'rbind' with the elements of the list as the
parameters so you are effectively creating a single data frame from
it.
>

> lapply(mylast,rbind)
This is applying 'rbind' separately to each element of the list (that
is what lapply does - call the function with each element) and will
return a list which is exactly the same.

What you are effectively doing is calling data.frame with as many
parameters as you have elements of the list.  See what happens with:

> data.frame(a=list(a=1,b=2), b=list(a=3,b=4))
  a.a a.b b.a b.b
1   1   2   3   4

Does MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING mean the rename over an existing file is actually
atomic?  I cannot find any MSDN docs that say so (and I've seen some that
suggest to me that it probably isn't).

If it's not atomic, then this doesn't offer any advantage over shutil.move that
I can see (and in fact would damage the usefulness of os.rename, which is
currently atomic on all platforms AFAIK, even though it cannot succeed all the
time).

If MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING miraculously turns out to be atomic, then my
opinion is:

  * this feature would be very useful, and I would like a cross-platform way to
    do this in Python.
  * this feature should not be called ""os.rename"", which for years has done
    something else on some platforms, and so changing it will invite unnecessary
    breakage.  A new function would be better, or perhaps an optional flag.  I
    propose ""os.atomic_rename"".

Also, I assume this cannot replace files that are in use?

I'd be ok with a flag, but it should have a cross-platform name.
""require_atomic"" or ""replace"" or something like that.  I think a new function
makes more sense, though.

I don't quite follow what you're saying here, but I'd be against an operation
called ""rename"" that sometimes was atomic and sometimes wasn't.

My answer is ""it depends"". Using regression on zero/one dummy variables
can work, but there are more direct approaches to classification that
might work better.

In the case that you showed us, the data were linearly separable by one
predictor. If the data that you posted are representative of your
typical data sets, you might want to use a very simple approach:
identify the important predictor and use an ROC curve to find a good
cutoff for it. You don't need the other data.

However, if these data represent an ""easy"" case, you might want to try
other approaches to classification. I usually start with either
randomForest or a bagged tree (see the randomForest and ipred packages).
If I can get good performance with those models, I'll try simpler models
that are more interpretable, like single trees (the rpart package), FDA
with method = mars (using the mda package) and other approaches.

Dear Max,

Thank you very much ! Your sample code is very helpful.

In linear separable problem, I should use fda by linear regression
instead of bruto unless taking some dimensional reduction process,  
should I?

Cheers.

      Notes:  Data for 1995 through 1999 are final.  All other
  data are preliminary unless otherwise noted.  Estimates for the
  most recent two months are derived from the Short-Term
  Integrated Forecasting System (STIFS). See Natural Gas Monthly,
  Appendix A Explanatory Note 7 for a discussion of revision
  policy.  Gas in storage at the end of a reporting period may
  not equal the quantity derived by adding or subtracting net
  injections or withdrawals during the period to the quantity of
  gas in storage at the beginning of the period.  Totals may not
  equal sum of components because of independent rounding. 
  Geographic coverage is the 50 States and the District of
  Columbia.

Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.

If he sent e-mail to me, my server would also reject it, then you would 
not be alone.  But seriously, I wonder if setting up /etc/nsswitch.conf 
to check ""files"" first and adding an entry to /etc/hosts would fix it e.g.

64.22.240.195   ns.ky3.com

I am not sure how postfix verifies fqdn, if it uses the OS resolver 
stack or some other method.

Jonathan Worthington <jonathan@jnthn.net>,parrot-porters@perl.org,"Tue, 10 Apr 2007 00:32:41 +0100",Class/Role namespace links,"Hi,

Tonight I started working on the association between classes and 
namespaces as specified in PDD15. Have some questions.

1) I added a ""slot"" to the NameSpace PMC to hold a Class or Role PMC a 
while back. However, there is no interface specified for storing/getting 
at this slot. For now I've added ""set_class"" and ""get_class"" METHODs to 
the NameSpace PMC. What should these actually be called (if something 
else)? Whatever is decided on should be added to a PDD somewhere - I 
guess the NameSpce PDD.

2) I see that we now just have a .name method and no .namespace method. 
For Class, the description of the name method says:

""The accessor for the name attribute. With no argument, it simply 
returns the current value for name. When passed an argument, it sets the 
name of the class, and also sets the association with a namespace. With 
no argument it only returns the current value of the name attribute.""

That is a little unclear to me. What should the name slot be set to - 
the name of the most nested bit of the namespace (e.g. for [ ""Animal"" ; 
""Monkey"" ], name is ""Monkey"")?

Also, what should it return? Just the name attribute? What if you really 
want to get at the namespace?

Finally, note that Role says something different - I guess these should 
be consistent?

3) For Role (but not Class - mistake?), it says:

""When you associate a class with a namespace, it pulls in all of the 
methods and vtable methods held within that namespace.""

At the moment, we do not carry the "":method"" adverb on subs through to 
the PBC. Thus while I guess you can iterate a namespace (not tried it 
yet, just assuming you can since it's derived from Hash) and test for 
PMCs to make sure they are Subs. However, beyond that you have no way of 
knowing if it's a method or not (so far as I can see, I'd love to be 
corrected on this if anyone knows otherwise). Should :method be carried 
through to a PBC level?

4) After this it says:

""And when replacing one class with another in the association, it 
removes any methods and vtable methods from the previous class.""

Remove methods from what? The class or the namespace? If the class, does 
it remove all methods from the class then pull in ones from the new 
namespace? Or do we look at the old namespace and see what methods it 
has, then remove just ones that appear there?

Thanks,

Jonathan

My question was about Vista.  My ThinkPad came with XP Home and I have
both Admin and user accounts on it.  User accounts in XP Home do not
have admin rights.  However, most people never get past that first
account, which does have admin rights.

I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Thanks!

Chris

+VFS ReadAhead Plugin
+====================
+
+Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved 
+performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
+allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
+for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
+Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between 
+Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
+module by adding the following lines to the share definition
+in smb.conf:
+
+[file_share]
+	vfs objects = readahead
+	readahead:length = 1M
+
+Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
+due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
+Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.

that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).

Just my 2 cents.

license, a license which makes it possible that I can work on another 
PC, without paying a lot of money. R produces quite good results and is 
widely used. That makes it a statistical package that I want.
The other thing is that working with large datasets requires ""some"" 
effort by software makers to get it working. I doubt if R has the 
capability of working consistently with large datasets. That is an issue 
I think. I have done some comparisons between SPSS and R, and R seems to 
be performing allright, so I can do computations with it. Nonetheless: 
the data handling is not quite as good I think in comparison with SAS.

When I started doing statistics there were about three packages: SPSS, 
SAS and BMDP (at least: these were available). On a PC you were required 
to use SPSS.
Nowadays there are hundreds, some with excellent database facilities, or 
you can compute the newest statistical tests, or an exotic one. I 
haven't got a clue how to work with new database facilities. dBase was 
my only database education and everything has changed. So I cannot 
answer if R is capable of working with large datasets in relation to 
databases. I really don't know. The only thing I know that if I compute 
a ChiSq, it works on a relatively large dataset (not Fisher tests by the 
way). The same with a likelihood procedure, or tabulations including 
non-parametrics or factor analysis.   But databases are an issue I've 
been told by a guy who works with R. SAS was a better option he told me.

So what's the big deal about S using files instead of memory like R. I 
don't get the point. Isn't there enough swap space for S? (Who cares 
anyway: it works, isn't it?) Or are there any problems with S and large 
datasets? I don't get it. You use them, Greg. So you might discuss that 
issue.

Wilfred










The licences keep changing, some have in the past but don't now, some
you can get an additional licence for home at a discounted price. Some
it depends on the type of licence you have at work (currently our SAS
licence is such that the 3 people in my group can all have it installed,
but at most 1 can be using it at any 1 time, how does that affect
installing/using it at home).  I may be able to install some of the
software at home also, but for most of them I have given up trying to
figure out the legality of it and so I have not installed them at home
to be on the safe side.

Some of the doctors I work with who are also affiliated with the local
university have mentioned that they can get a discounted academic
version of SAS and could use that, but my interpretation of the academic
licence that one showed me (probably not the most recent) said (in my
interpretation, I am not a lawyer) that if they published the results
without paying a licence upgrade fee, they would be violating the
licence (the academic version was intended for teaching only).

The R licence on the other hand is pretty clear that I can install it
and use it pretty much anywhere I want.

You are right in correcting me, R is not the only package that can be
used on multiple computers.  I do think it is the most straight forward
of the good ones.

CALL FOR PARTICIPATION

KI-2004 cordially invites AI researchers and practitioners to meet in
the beautiful town of Ulm on the banks of the Danube in September this
year.

An attractive technical programme has been put together, which covers
a particularly broad spectrum of subfields in AI theory and
practice. It comprises paper and poster presentations, a variety of
specialised workshops and is highlighted by a number of invited talks
from the areas of Automated Reasoning (Jörg Siekmann), Robot Planning
(Malik Ghallab), Constraint Reasoning (François Fages), Machine
Learning (Martin Riedmiller), and Semantic Web (Wolfgang Wahlster).

KI-2004 is co-located with INFORMATIK 2004, the German Conference on
Informatics. KI and INFORMATIK share a joint day of invited
presentations. In addition to the talks by Wolfgang Wahlster and Malik
Ghallab, which are part of this joint programme, various speakers from
academia and industry will give keynotes on their visions in areas
like Ubiquitous Computing, Web Services, and Business Process
Management.

We look forward to an exciting and inspiring conference and to welcome
you in Ulm shortly.

Subject:  Confidential Information and Securities Trading
 
To keep pace with the fluid and fast-changing demands of our equity trading activities, Enron Wholesale Services (""EWS"") has recently revised its official Policies and Procedures Regarding Confidential Information and Securities Trading (""Policies and Procedures""). These revisions reflect two major developments: (1) our equity trading activities have been extended into the United Kingdom, and (2) in an effort to streamline the information flow process, the ""Review Team"" will play a more centralized role, so that the role of the ""Resource Group"" is no longer necessary.You are required to become familiar with, and to comply with, the Policies and Procedures. The newly revised Policies and Procedures are available for your review on LegalOnline, the new intranet website maintained by the Enron Wholesale Services Legal Department. Please click on the attached link to access LegalOnline:
 
<http://legalonline.corp.enron.com/chinesewall.asp>
 
If you have already certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, you need not re-certify at this time, although you are still required to to review and become familiar with the revised Policies and Procedures. If you have not certified compliance with the Policies and Procedures during the 2001 calendar year, then you must do so within two weeks of your receipt of this message. The LegalOnline site will allow you to quickly and conveniently certify your compliance on-line with your SAP Personal ID number. If you have any questions concerning the Policies or Procedures, please call Bob Bruce at extension 5-7780 or Donna Lowry at extension 3-1939.

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Beautiful.  

I would like to add that we got the benefit of this method of calculating prejudgment interest because the arbitrators specifically adopted Northern's prejudgment interest methodology, which was based on the fine work Harry, Tangi and you did on our post-hearing briefs.  

Of even more significance,  the panel specifically noted KN's course of performance of using our meter numbers for its monthly plant settlements when the panel rejected ONEOK's argument that ONEOK had never ""accepted"" the meters.  Harry and Tangi brought this evidence to our attention at the outset of this litigation, and it became a centerpiece argument for us. With their and your fine work (and the unbelievable hours all of you put in, late at night, early in the morning, on the weekends, and frequently on an emergency basis, with little or no notice), you made ONEOK's attorneys very unhappy with your testimony at the hearing.  I loved it.

This was a team effort, and congratulations are due all the way around.  It was my great pleasure to have partnered with you on this.

Britt

Subject:	RE: Northern v. ONEOK

Britt,

We have done a thorough analysis of ONEOK's calculation of pre-judgment interest and are in agreement with their amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).  

The reason why the interest is due Northern (in apparent contradiction to Northern being instructed to pay ONEOK approximately $1.2 million dollars for the retroactive correction of the meter factor error) is tied to the calculation of the accumulated interest.  Since this is a dollar-valued OBA, each month's imbalance was valued at the appropriate monthly index price and a 6% simple interest calculation was applied from that month until the current period.  We had a significant amount of monthly imbalances due Northern early in the review period that carried forward very large credit interest balances due us.  For example, July 1998 had a credit imbalance due NNG valued at ($753,541.27).  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for 997 days (September 1998 through June 2001) resulted in a credit interest amount due NNG of ($123,498.19).  For comparison purposes, contrasting with this month is a large debit imbalance due ONEOK of $769,407.44 for the month of December 2000.  This amount calculated at a 6% interest rate for only 113 days (February 2001 through June 2001) resulted in a debit interest amount due ONEOK of $14,292.01.  By summarizing these two months, we have an imbalance value that is due ONEOK of $15,866.17 with a corresponding net interest valuation due Northern of ($109,206.18).  This scenario plays out for the entire review period netting to a cumulative credit amount due Northern of ($56,097.69).

If you would like to review the calculations in detail, please let me know and I will forward the spreadsheet to you.

Rick, Harry & Tangie

	Harry,

	We need your help yet one more time.  Tomorrow morning I will have hand-delivered to you a letter from Ben Singletary, ONEOK's attorney, stating that they calculate pre-judgment interest (using Northern's methodology, which the arbitrators specifically approved--thanks again to you, Tangi and Rick!) such that ONEOK actually owes Northern about $50,000.  We certainly don't mind them owing us $50,000; however, we want to see if ONEOK owes us even more than that.  

	If you need additional information (such as the actual panel award), please call Becky Zikes and she will make sure a copy gets to you.  I will be out from about 9:30 to 3:00 tomorrow, but will be in later in the day.

	Many thanks.

	Britt

I've got following problem. Sometimes mail attachments are truncated
and and e-mail is send but files are corrupted. 

Mail header contains then:
""X-Amavis-Alert: BAD HEADER MIME error: error: part did not end with
expected boundary"". And that is true - there is no boundary for MIME and
data stream is not completed.

I've turned on detailed postfix debugging and it looks like at some
point there is: 
 smtp_get: EOF
instead of:
 < some_IP: QUIT
 > some_IP: 221 2.0.0 Bye

Attachment is truncated after different sizes (sometimes 65kB, sometimes
200kB) and after different times (25s, 100s).

The only common thing I've found is that all such mails come from one internet
provider that is public-gprs*.centertel.pl

I guess it might be the problem with this provider (Orange Poland) but
on the other hand they can send e-mails through other mail servers
without such a problem.

I got stuck with it. Is there any way to debug it more? Do you have any
ideas what could be the cause?

I use postfix 2.3.8 on Debian Stable + amavis etc.

Thanks in advance!
Jakub

After reviewing the password applications available on the Clickpaper and EnronOnline websites it appears that several countries have access to EOL but not to Clickpaper (please see attached).    Since due dilligence has already been completed for the EOL countries and soon Clickpaper will migrate to the EnronOnline trading platform, it seems it might not be too difficult to add mirroring Clickpaper password applications.  Is that the case?  We have business interests in several of the countries accessible solely via EOL.

Vijay Gill <vijay@gl.umbc.edu>,9fans plan9 users list <9fans@cse.psu.edu>,"Mon, 07 Feb 1994 16:42:31 -0500",,"
The purpose of this list is to maintain a database of hardware that is
known to work with plan 9.  This should make life easier for those
people contemplating the purchase of new hardware.  Most of this list
is taken directly from what Forsyth sent me.  Please do not deluge him
with mail, reply to me and I'll try to set up a mechanism to distribute
this stuff.

 The list is starting out for the most selfish of reasons, since I am
in the market for some hardware to run plan 9, I thought it would be a
good idea to find out what to get.  This list will concentrate mostly
on the 386/486 clone hardware.  While the 386/486 machines are looked
upon with derision, they provide the cheapest hardware to run plan 9.
However, most of the hardware is only tested with, and comes with
drivers for, DOS and Windows, and thus may not work with plan 9.  This
list details the stuff that works with plan 9.

BeginBlurb:  
Plan 9 on a Mac.  No more futzing around. 
I could deal with plan 9 on a Powerbook 180.
End Blurb.

Contributors:

Most of this hardware list comes from forsyth@minster.york.ac.uk who
has done yeoman work to contributing to this list.  Actually, come to
think of it, his is about the only contribution ;)

Here is the list of hardware that will work with plan 9.  Other
hardware may work with plan 9, but this list will only list stuff that
is known to work or stuff that I need confirmation on.

-----------------------------------------------------
Bus:
	ISA
	VESA
	EISA (may work with ISA Cards, need confirmation)
-----------------------------------------------------
CPU:
	Intel
	AMD - To be tested by Forsyth
	Cyrix - Ditto
	IBM SLC - Ditto
------------------------------------------------------
Video Cards:

This is the trickiest part.  SVGA cards all have different ways of
configuring and operating high-resolution modes (higher than 640x480
VGA).

	ET4000 SVGA cards work.
	S3 911 cards work
	Paradise cards (reportedly) work.
	Diamond Stealth Pro cards work, with some changes
		to devvga.c and lib/vga.  This is from
		Gary Chapel.

------------------------------------------------------
Ethernet cards:

	WD
	SMC
	NE2000 clones (Reset port address it uses
		       might not work on some clones)
	3Com 3C509 Etherlink III (need to get some fixes
		       to use the driver under very heavy
		       loads)
	3Com 3C503 -- Avoid this one


------------------------------------------------------------
Hard Disk Controllers:

	Ultrastor 14F SCSI (driver is available by ftp)
	Adaptec 1542B/Buslogic 542B (driver is available,
		but hasn't been used very much)
	Forsyth has added the driver for the Ultrastor 14F.
	He has used it on both cpu and terminal machines,
	and also on the file server, running Fujitsu 2624FA
	disks, Seagate 3283N and Sun CDROM drives.

	Standard IDE controllers should work.
--------------------------------------------------------------
Memory:

	8-16 megs should be adequate.  More is better.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Modems:

	High speed modems will work but the kernel does not take
	advantage of the FIFO's in the 16550 UARTS.  Forsyth can
	supply the diffs and the appropriate changes that will work
	for `hayes', which work fine upto 38400.
	
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Diskettes:

	Stick with 3.5"" 1.44 meg or 5.25"".  Plan 9 does not
	work too well with 2.88 meg 3.5"".

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Disks:

The pc system on the distribution (Jan 1993 version) supports
IDE disks.  The IDE driver has a bug in it that causes it to fail
on very old Seagate 42 Meg drives (fixed by Forsyth).  Modern IDE
drives work just fine.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the list as it stands.  If you have plan 9 running on
different hardware, please send me details.

War stories welcomed, to go into the war stories list. I presently
have Forsyth's war story. More input welcomed.  I will be looking at
putting this stuff up for anon ftp when I have sufficient volume.  If
there is sufficient interest, I'll post up the war stories that I
have.

 Yes, it is possible to prove any regular inequality E1 =< E2 (as well as
any regular equation E1 = E2) in a pure algebraic way -- without
constructing DFA's for the expressions involved.

 1.  As far as regular equations are concerned, such a way has been
described in [1].  It is an algebraic calculus presented in the form
of a term-rewriting system. I have written a program in OBJ3 (an
algebraic programming language) implementing this calculus.  If
someone is interested in getting the program (together with quite
complete instructions how to run it, examples, etc.), send me please a
request by e-mail.

 2.  Since E1 =< E2 is equivalent to E1 + E2 = E2, the abovementioned
calculus can also be used for proving/disproving regular inequalities.
However, there exists a more direct (and more efficient) algebraic
procedure based on so-called ""partial derivatives"".  Below I outline it.

 Consider the set Reg of regular expressions on a given alphabet A:

  Reg ::= 0 | 1 | x | Reg . Reg | Reg + Reg | Reg *

where 0 denotes the empty language, 1 is a unit language, x is a letter
from A, and the three other operations -- concatenation, regular union,
and Kleene star -- have standard meaning.

 Let Reg0, Reg1 be subsets of Reg defined by the following grammars:

  Reg0 ::= 0 | x | Reg0 . Reg | Reg . Reg0 | Reg0 + Reg0

  Reg1 ::= 1 | Reg1 . Reg1 | Reg1 + Reg | Reg + Reg1 | Reg *

One can check that Reg is a disjoint union of Reg0 and Reg1 and that for
any a0 \\in Reg0 and a1 \\in Reg1 the inequality 1 =< a0 is false and 1 =<
a1 is true.) 

 Let Set[Reg] denote the set of all finite sets of reg.  expressions.

DEFINITION ( [3] ) 
 Given x \\in A, the function d_x : Reg -> Set[Reg], computing the set
of partial derivatives of its argument w.r.t. x, is defined
recursively by the following equations:

  d_x(0) = d_x(1) = {} (* an empty set *),
  d_x(y) = if y == x then { 1 } else {} fi,
  d_x(a+b) = d_x(a) \\cup d_x(b),
  d_x(a0.b) = d_x(a0).b,
  d_x(a1.b) = d_x(a1).b \\cup d_x(b),
  d_x(a*) = d_x(a).a*

for all y\\in A, a,b \\in Reg, a0 \\in Reg0, a1 \\in Reg1.  Here the
extension of concatenation _._ to Set[Reg] is defined in the following
way:

  R . 0 = {}, 
  {} . t = {},
  {0} . t = {},
  {1} . t = {t},
  {a} . t = {a.t} if a =/= 0, a =/= 1,
  (R \\cup R').t = (R.t)\\cup (R'.t)

for any R, R' \\in Set[Reg], t \\in Reg, t =/= 0, a\\in Reg.
--------------------

  Given a set R \\in Set[Reg], let \\sum R be either 0 if R={}, or a sum
(regular union) a + b + ... of non-zero elements a, b, ... of R. Note
that here the regular union _+_ is considered to be associative,
commutative and idempotent (while in the above definition of d_x() all
regular expressions are treated as free terms).


DEFINITION ( [2] ) Given a, b \\in Reg, x\\in A, and p \\in d_x(a), the
inequality p =< \\sum d_x(b) is called a ""partial derivative of a regular
inequality a =< b w.r.t. the letter x"".
  Let pd_x(a =< b) be the set of all partial derivatives of a =< b w.r.t.
x.  Given a set S of inequalities, let pd_x(S)=\\bigcup_{s\\in S}pd_x(s).
------------------

 Iterating this definition, one obtains partial derivatives of a =< b
w.r.t. non-empty words on A:

	pd_{wx}(a =< b) =  pd_x(pd_w(a =< b)).

for all w\\in A^+, x \\in A.


THEOREM ( [2] ) 
 1.  The set 

	PD(a=<b) = \\bigcup_{w\\in A^+} pd_w(a =< b) 

of all possible partial derivatives of a =< b w.r.t. all non-empty words
on A is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to
\\let(a)*2^\\let(b) where \\let(r) is the number of occurrences of alphabet
letters appearing in the reg.  expression r.

 2. If a =< b is a valid inequality (i.e., the regular language denoted by
a is a subset of one denoted by b), then all its partial derivatives are
also valid. If a =< b is not valid, then the set PD(a =< b) contains at
least one ""trivially inconsistent"" inequality of the form p1 =< q0 where
p1\\in Reg1, q0\\in Reg0.  
------------------


 This gives the following procedure to decide whether a regular
inequality a=<b is valid:

 1. Check if a=<b is ""trivially inconsistent"", i.e. if a\\in Reg1, b\\in
Reg0 -- then a=<b = false. 

 2. Otherwise, compute the set pd_x(a =< b) for all the letters x
occuring in a. If one of the new inequalities is ""trivially
inconsistent"", then a=<b is disproved. Otherwise, keep computing partial
derivatives of new inequalities until either you get a ""trivially
inconsistent"" inequality, or the set of inequalities becomes saturated
(no new partial derivative can be obtained). In the latter case, a=<b is
valid -- as well as all the obtained partial derivatives of a=<b.

(See [3] for a natural way to compute partial derivatives through
so-called non-deterministic linear forms).


 This is indeed a decision procedure, but its efficiency can be
drastically improved using simple ""logical"" observations. First, it's
quite clear that it makes no sense to differentiate inequalities like

         a =< a, a =< a + b, 0 =< a, 1 =< a1 

etc. which are ""trivial tautologies"". These should just be removed from
the set of inequalities to be checked. Second, if two inequalities of the
form a =< b and a =< b + c occurs in the set, then the second one can
also be removed, since it is a logical consequence of the first one.

 It is proved in [2] that with these optimizations the procedure in some
cases is *EXPONENTIALLY* faster that any one constructing DFA for the
expressions involved -- you can check it yourself on the following
example:

   (a* b)* (a a ... a) a *  =< (a + b)* a (a+b)...(a+b)
            ^-------^                     ^------------^
             n times                        n-1 times 

(it is known that the minimal DFA for the right-hand side has 2^n
states, but our procedure -- with the optimizations described above --
generates only n+2 partial derivatives to be checked).

FWIW, the behaviour of the two examples is what I would have expected.
(Though I had to think about the second case a bit: initially I expected
it to do exactly what the first case does.)

>From perlvar:
         $
               Contains the subpattern from the corresponding set of capturing
               parentheses from the last pattern match, not counting patterns
               matched in nested blocks that have been exited already.
               (Mnemonic: like \\digits.)  These variables are all read-only
               and dynamically scoped to the current BLOCK.

It is unfortunate that the documentation does not more carefully define
what it means by ""nested block"" here: from the point of view of the read
access of $1 in the examples, the inner match is not occurring in a nested
block. From the point of view of the program as a whole, the second case
certainly contains a nested block; the first case might or might not,
depending what ""nested"" means; the first case also either might or might
not have ""exited"" its block (nested or no), depending on precisely what
""exited"" means - my own interpretation is that it hasn't exited the block
yet, but that's a sentiment based more on my limited understanding of the
implementation than on any documentation.

If we can work out what the documentation is supposed to be saying, and
what all the words mean, maybe we have a better chance of deciding whether
the implementation matches that, and if not, fixing it.

Hi,
I would like to install Plan 9 from a cdrom mounted on our UNIX host.
The problem is that every filename.
Is there a way to copy files from the CD to the 386 (using mkfs ...)
without having a Plan 9 fileserver ?

regards
Thomas

NLRB ALJ RECOMMENDS AVONDALE REIMBURSE GOVERNMENT FOR LEGAL
FEES

Finding that Avondale Industries conducted a ""pervasive
course of unlawful conduct"" before and during a union
organizing drive among some 4,000 employees at its New
Orleans shipyard, a National Labor Relations Board
administrative law judge recommends that the company be
required to repay the federal government some $5.4 million
in legal fees it billed the Navy. The ALJ also recommends
that Avondale, which is now owned by Northrup Grumman, be
required to reinstate 22 employees who were illegally
terminated for their union activities (""Avondale Industries
Inc. and New Orleans Metal Trade Council, ""N.L.R.B. ALJ, No.
15-CA-12639,7/6/01 [released 7/11/01])

In a 275-page decision, ALJ Philip P. McLeod further
recommends that the company be required to reimburse both
NLRB and the New Orleans Metal Trade Council for their
litigation fees, as well as the NLRB general counsel's
expenses in investigating the ULP cases. . . . Page AA-1

HOUSE HEARING EXAMINES OVERLAP IN GENETIC BIAS LEGISLATION

In the first House hearing this year on legislation that
would ban genetic discrimination in employment and health
insurance (H.R. 602), lawmakers question whether a
broad-based bill is necessary given existing federal and
state laws that address the issue.

Rep. Stearns (R-Fla.), who chairs the House Energy and
Commerce Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer
Protections, asks sponsors of the legislation--Reps.
Slaughter (D-N.Y.) and Morella (R-Md.)--whether a new law is
necessary.  He cites the 1996 Health Insurance Portability
and Accountability Act, which prohibits private group health
insurers from setting rates or refusing coverage to
individuals based on their genetic makeup.  Saying only
people who are currently insured are covered by HIPAA,
Slaughter maintains that any congressional effort to ban
genetic discrimination should encompass both employment and
health insurance and should contain ""meaningful enforcement
and remedies."" . . . Page A-8

FORD ANNOUNCES CHANGE IN ANNUAL EVALUATION SYSTEM FOR
MANAGERS

Ford Motor Co. announces it is changing a controversial
annual evaluation system for its approximately 18,000
managers and supervisors that has triggered a spate of age
discrimination suits. In a memorandum explaining the change
to employees, Ford Chief Executive Officer Jacques Nasser
acknowledges that the original program had not been entirely
well received, saying the negative feedback ""has centered
around what was viewed as an inflexible system by some, and
as discriminatory by a few others."" But he insists the
evaluation program ""has ""nothing"" to do with age or
diversity. It has ""everything"" to do with inspiring the best
performance of ""everyone"" on the management team.""

A class action lawsuit against Ford for age discrimination
brought by about 60 managers ""is proceeding full steam
ahead"" despite the company's announcement that it is
changing the evaluation system at issue, class attorney
Michael Pitt says. ""There are substantial economic and
noneconomic injuries to these people, ranging from $20,000
to $50,000 each, and Ford has given no indication that it
will correct these injuries,"" the attorney says. . . . Page

STATE'S IMMUNITY DID NOT BAR ADA SUIT, BUT WORKER COULD NOT
PROVE CASE

Even though the sovereign immunity doctrine did not block a
public employee's Americans with Disabilities Act suit
against the head of the Kansas Department of Corrections,
the plaintiff, who had multiple sclerosis, failed to
establish that he was disabled under the act, the Tenth
Circuit rules (""Frazier v. Simmons,  ""10th Cir.,  No.
00-3131,  7/3/01).

A state's Eleventh Amendment sovereign immunity to suits in
federal court that seek money damages for ADA violations
does not apply where a plaintiff seeks prospective equitable
relief from a particular state official, Judge Brorby holds,
finding that Steve E. Frazier properly alleged a claim for
injunctive relief against the secretary of the Department of
Corrections. However, Frazier failed to establish that he
was qualified for his job--a crime scene investigator--at
the time he was terminated because he could not perform
certain essential functions, the court says, affirming
summary judgment for Simmons.  . . . Page A-7,  Text E-1

CONTRACTOR BACK WAGE PAYMENTS TIED TO GOVERNMENT
REIMBURSEMENT

A government contractor who underpaid its employees due to a
misunderstanding regarding Labor Department wage
classifications need not reimburse those employees until the
contracting agency adjusts the compensation levels to
reflect those classifications, the Federal Circuit rules
(""Richlin Security Service Co. v. Immigration and
Naturalization Service,""Fed. Cir., No. 00-1134, 7/2/01).
Richlin Security Service Co. is not liable for the back
wages owed to its security guards for services provided
under contracts with the Immigration and Naturalization
Service until it receives reimbursement from the agency,
according to the court.

 Overturning a decision by the Department of Transportation
Board of Contract Appeals, the court upholds an agreement
between the company and the Labor Department stipulating
that the employees would be paid the back wages owed
following reimbursement by the INS. ""In view of the
DOL-Richlin agreement which assures Richlin will receive no
benefit from these payments, it was unnecessary to require
Richlin to pay the employees before INS supplied the funds
to which it was obligated,"" the court holds. . . . Page A-2

ELEVENTH CIRCUIT RULES ADEA PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT PLEAD
DISPARATE IMPACT

In a case of first impression, the Eleventh Circuit rules
that disparate impact claims may not be brought under the
Age Discrimination in Employment Act (""Adams v. Florida
Power Corp., "" 11th Cir.,  No. 99-15306,  7/5/01). ""The text
of the ADEA is sufficiently different from Title VII [of the
1964 Civil Rights Act] to raise doubts about extending the
disparate impact theory of liability to ADEA cases,"" Judge
Birch writes. In addition, ""the history of the ADEA differs
from the legislative history of Title VII.""

The Second, Eighth, and Ninth circuits allow disparate
impact claims under the ADEA, while the First, Third, Sixth,
Seventh, and Tenth do not, the court says. Finding the
reasoning of the First and Tenth Circuits persuasive, the
Eleventh Circuit affirms a ruling by the U.S. District Court
for the Middle District of Florida decertifying a class of
former Florida Power Corp. employees who alleged they were
discharged in violation of the ADEA. . . . Page A-2

Exsqueeze me, but what part of ""I don't know if it's true or not""
did you fail to grok?  I personally doubt it simply because I never
heard of Bush and Chirac going to Brighton.

Next time I hear a joke, I promise not to laugh until I have checked

we have you around to keep us on the straight and narrow, all the while

I think the problem with general use of backtracking is that, while
convenient, it's less efficient than improved algorithms are for any given
task.  (Compare recursive vs. nonrecursive algorithms as another example.)
Nevertheless, when it's needed (no readily available non-backtracking
algorithm available in a timely fashion) backtracking is very useful.

But, obtained fit$fitted.values are enormously high (or low) .
Execution of bruto(x[,2:3], y) is done well (values are nearly 1 or 0).
Values of column 1 are wrong or appropriate option is needed?
I contacted the package maintainer, but the problem could not be solved.

Here is some *non-definitive, non-exhaustive* data concerning the tools/build/*.pl scripts 
that may be useful in this effort.

1.  Invocations by 'make':

  94 tools/build/c2str.pl
   4 tools/build/dynpmc.pl
   1 tools/build/fingerprint_c.pl
   2 tools/build/jit2c.pl
   1 tools/build/nativecall.pl
  12 tools/build/ops2c.pl
   1 tools/build/ops2pm.pl
   2 tools/build/parrot_config_c.pl
 179 tools/build/pmc2c.pl
   1 tools/build/revision_c.pl
   1 tools/build/vtable_extend.pl

tools/build/vtable_h.pl has not been invoked by make since Nov 11 2006.  However, it may 
be invoked elsewhere.  See config/gen/parrot_include.pm (54); lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/
Tools.pm (51); lib/Parrot/Vtable.pm (16, 419).

2.  Quite a few of the tools/build/*.pl scripts are called by Parrot::Docs::Sections::Tools.  
Personally, I don't think providing a Perl script as an argument to a Perl method call is a ""best 
practice.""  So I view these instances as ripe for refactoring.

lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:49:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/nativecall.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:50:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/jit2c.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:51:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/vtable_h.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:52:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/
vtable_extend.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:56:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/pbc2c.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:82:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/
fingerprint_c.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:85:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/
parrot_config_c.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:87:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/
revision_c.pl' ),
lib/Parrot/Docs/Section/Tools.pm:104:            $self->new_item( '', 'tools/build/
list_unjitted.pl' ),

I haven't yet looked at scripts in other directories such as tools/dev/.

That's not a question for the plugin.  The plugin merely sets the
responder on/off and with a message.  Your mail delivery system does
the actual autoresponding.  You need to know how to configure your
autoresponse system.  If you don't know how to do that, read up on
your mail system and ask in the right forum.  Also note that ""Local
User Autoresponder and Mail Forwarder"" will also work for you, but the
answer to your question will still be the same.

I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

Jeff, 

No action is required on your part at this time. This memo was in response to your question in the weekly EGM staff meeting. 

Iain Greig and Randal Frisbie will be in touch in the next couple of weeks. We would like to set up a meeting to discuss your vision for the next release of Position Manager. New requirements (e.g. - backward cumulative roll) that you mentioned in the demo are already being planned for. 

Ideally, we'd like to install MoneyPenny onto your desk top so that you can use it and help us understand what other things need to be added. 

Thanks.

Jeff, 

Here are a few deliverables that should provide answers to the question you posed on Monday about Thunderball. 

1) The first spreadsheet lists the traders and risk analysts in each office that are involved in user acceptance testing for Position Manager and the schedule for signoff. (User Rollout 626.xls)

2) The second document higlights current overall status for the Moneypenny trading application. (DevStat625.doc)

3) The third document highlights future Position Manager functionality. This is an initial draft that will be confirmed with key traders as well as Todd Hall.  We will then set up a meeting to get your input and review. Note, this includes key requirements that you requested in the system demo such as support for a Cumulative Backward Roll view within Position Manager. (PosMgrR2...)

Let me know if you have further questions. 

Thanks.

Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.

Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.

> I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.

  Hi!  Im wondering what advice anyone has regarding this issue:

  When one of our users sends an email with a large amount of local
users listed in the BCC that contains a sizable attachment, it can
sometimes trigger a 'bcc storm'.  

  We have a single F5 load balancer that various services flow through.
A single email transaction can 'loop' through one piece of equipment
multiple times. When one of these 'bcc storms' takes place, because of
this 'looping', it can max out the interfaces to the F5.

  We've taken some measures to prevent this by reducing the number of
different types of services that pass through our load balancer, and
reverted to using RR DNS instead.

  But Im wondering what else can be done.  Taking a look at the q-shape
postfix readme, I see discussion regarding the
'default_destination_concurrency_limit' parameter which sounds
promising, but it affects *all* destinations.

  It there any way to control concurrency limits on a per-host basis?

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove
the appropiate zone(s) on your slaves, and refresh your DNS servers.

Bind has a special case, if you set the serial to '0' I think. DNS &
Bind should have something on that.

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

Up to you.  Usually if anyone is going to reply without prodding it
happens within a 24 hours (if you send out the draft on the weekend I
tended to wait until Monday evening).

Dave Mason <dmason@plg.uwaterloo.ca>,gary@joyce.cs.su.OZ.AU,"Wed, 09 Feb 1994 10:41:24 -0500",no emacs in plan 9,"   Date: Wed, 9 Feb 1994 09:32:37 -0500
   From: gary@joyce.cs.su.OZ.AU (Gary Capell)

   acme is a better emacs than emacs, because it uses the mouse
   fully, and is a _tool_ that other programs can use, rather
   than a monolith.

Sounds good for mouse exploiters.

But what if I don't want to use the damn mouse?  Call me neanderthal,
but I'm not willing to slow my work down by a factor of 2 to use a
mouse.  Does acme support alt/control/shift key bindings?

(For reference, I touch the mouse maybe 5 times a day... all my
Xwindow focus, open, iconify, etc. are bound to key sequences.)

I'm not in love with emacs... in fact I detest many aspects of it, but
it's far better than all the other tools I have available... and it
lives on all the machines I have to use.

Maybe start by figuring out how to do it without R -
what's the approach, and how would you calculate it?
Then search R help for the possible key words you

You are right. I just checked cygwin's rename() code and it is
convincing enough for me to withdraw the patch.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

>>Last I heard, there was support only for the mips/sparc machines as 
>>fileservers.

it isn't on the CDROM, but given /sys/src/9/pc and a little background
knowledge, producing /sys/src/fs/pc wasn't too hard.
producing 9pccpu (CPU server configuration) is even easier.  any cpu server
can be used as an authentication server, so that's that!

(thanks to the Labs we are back in the `use the source' era!)

a 486dx2/66 seems quite a bit faster than a Sparc Classic; i use a dx2/66
as a CPU server, and even with a 24Mb classic as a terminal i tended
to do (cross)compilations on the 486.  i use a very lowly 16Mb 486sx33
as a file server (it doesn't use floating point).  it's adequate for
a small number of users (certainly not the bottleneck at present).

>>The problem with PCs is that if users have them on their desks, most of them 
>>want/demand Windows.

i was expecting that many people here would replace old Suns by PCs to run Windows,
because they don't program much (or they like Visual Basic),
so the intention wasn't to preclude that,
BUT for those who preferred a Unix environment i thought it might be
nice to consider more interesting hardware than Sun provides.

of course, the PC configuration will be chosen to allow people to
run Linux, Amoeba and of course Plan 9 if that takes their fancy.
as cs.wisc.edu!bob observed, the faster Intel and non-Intel clones are
competitive in performance and usually much cheaper than equivalent
RISC machines:

>>I highly recommend the new Pentium machines. For under $US4k you
>>can get a machine that is very powerful (~40mips, 32Meg mem, 540M disk).

it's also nice on the PC to be able to plug in a wide range of cheap special-purpose
cards (although register-level programming information isn't always available).
furthermore, most fast PCs come with a reasonable amount of fast
second-level cache, which can make a difference.

even so, i don't think the 386/486 architecture has got enough truly
general purpose registers for some things i'd like to do
(not really enough for basic bitblt, come to that).
the 64k banking of most non-PCI graphics cards is also a disincentive, and
makes graphics implementation harder and slower.  on a more personal level,
i get dizzy every time i get near the register level programming of SVGA.

90 and 100Mhz Pentium machines, especially with PCI,
should make very good, cheap file and CPU servers.
there are even multi-processor variants.
in those applications weak graphics performance matters not a bit.

unless you are considering graphics or multimedia work (both of
which interest me a bit) and possibly floating-point
intensive work (traditionally a weak area for Intel machines),
the underlying awfulness of the Intel architecture doesn't appear at all
with either Plan 9 (or Linux, come to that), and with those
exceptions i'd certainly consider a fast PC as a Plan 9 terminal.
(in fact, i use a 486 at home.)
it is indeed hard to match the price.

Based upon the info provided on Tuesday, I would hope that we can
immediately put this issue to bed.

My opinion is that we should stick with the original plan to either (1)
exchange all the 1% GP interests in the second and third-tier OLPs' for a
1% interest in the MLP or (2) eliminate the 1% interest in the third tier
partnerships.  In both cases, the result is that the GP receives a 1.99% or
a 2% interest in the consolidated income of the MLP and s/eliminate any
need for a fairness opinion on the part of the Audit Committee.

I briefly went over the calculation w/Rod on late Tuesday and he was
""tentatively"" in agreement but wanted to study this over the holiday.  The
issues raised by an effective 2% interest in the third tier partnerships
would make a fairness opinion very, very impractical.

Give me a call on Thursday to discuss.  We want to go over our ""final""
recommendation w/Stan on Tuesday.

Re:  Reorganization

     The purpose of this memorandum is to discuss a proposal relating to
the reorganization of EOTT Energy Partners that will enable it to prepare
and file as soon as possible a registration statement covering publicly
offered debt.

     On Thursday I received a voice mail from Paula Dubberly of the SEC
staff indicating that the staff would not go along with our idea of
avoiding
the requirement for separate operating limited partnership financial
statements by having EOTT Energy Partners (the MLP) guarantee the general
partner interests in the operating partnerships.  It is clear that the
staff
has no interest in helping us, although it clearly has the power to do so.
Although I plan to call Paula, I have little hope that it will do any good.

     I previously prepared a powerpoint presentation showing the steps in
the reorganization and a memorandum with a timetable for effecting the
reorganization.  The reorganization steps are straightforward.  The
principal time consideration was the action of the Audit Committee in
approving the reorganization, which will involve a transaction between EOTT
Energy Corp. and the MLP that might be challenged absent a determination of
fairness from the Audit Committee.  That transaction is the exchange of
EOTT
Energy Corp.'s 1% general partner interests in the original three operating
limited partnerships for an additional interest in the MLP itself.  I also
prepared a memorandum setting forth the case for giving EOTT Energy Corp.
an
additional .99%, based on the argument that this would speed up the
reorganization and reduce its costs by avoiding the need for the Audit
Committee to hire an investment banking firm to render a fairness opinion.

     I have done some additional thinking and believe that it makes sense
to consider effecting the reorganization and then engaging the Audit
Committee afterward to determine (with the assistance of an investment
banking firm) a fair exchange ratio.  The terms of the reorganization would
provide that the interest received by EOTT Energy Corp. would be a minimum
of a .99% interest and a maximum of a 1.97% interest but that the actual
percentage interest would be determined by the Audit Committee following
the
reorganization, based appraisals of the interests by an independent
investment banking firm.  The Audit Committee would determine the value of
EOTT Energy Corp.'s interests in the original operating partnerships and,
based on that value, an equivalent additional interest in the MLP.  The MLP
could proceed with the registration statement because the difference
between
the minimum and maximum amount that EOTT Energy Corp. would receive is
immaterial (and irrelevant to potential debt holders because it merely
measures how the equity holders divide the pie).

     The reorganization could be effected without a unitholder vote if
the EOTT Energy Corp. board of directors determines that the reorganization
does not adversely affect the limited partners in any material respect.  I
believe that this is a determination that the board can reasonably make,
without the need for advance Audit Committee action.  The only issue with
the structure of the transaction is that the general partner of the
operating limited partnerships will now be wholly-owned by the MLP, and the
wholly owned subsidiary that is the general partner, rather than EOTT
Energy
Corp., would be liable for the debts and obligations of any operating
limited partnership to the extent its liabilities exceeded its assets.
However, in light of the fact that such a scenario is remote and there are
great advantages in terms of cost savings in effecting the reorganization,
the board could reasonably determine that any adverse effects are
immaterial.

     I believe that if this approach is adopted, the MLP could be in a
position to file a registration statement within three weeks of the
commencement of the process.  I have prepared a revised timetable for such
a
proposal.

                                         RSB

Vijay Gill <vijay@gl.umbc.edu>,9fans plan9 users list <9fans@cse.psu.edu>,"Sun, 03 Apr 1994 00:26:48 -0500",Plan 9 vs. Adversary,"
Somehow I've managed to convince people to set up a lab using plan 9 as 
the base system (plan 9 running on IBM PC Clones).  Now a couple of 
questions I can't answer yet (still waiting on CD).  

	1.  Is there a secure way to authenticate users? (last I read in 
	    plan 9 papers was that the authors planned to move to 
	    something like kerberos and I've been hearing things
	    about authentication servers.  Can anyone update me on this?
	    Also, the papers mention that there is no way for anyone
	    to read/delete files that the user in question has removed
	    permissions from.  This leads to a quick question? How do
	    we remove accounts from the system once a class is over?

	2.  Is there a way to enforce disk quotas?  I don't want some
	    malicious user filling up the entire disk and then pretending
	    that it was the output of an infinite loop writing out to 
	    disk and that they didn't know that it could do that, hence
	    could we have an extention on our project since the entire
	    class could not do any work?  This has happened before.

	3.  I have some more money coming in and looking at the new Sun
	    announcement, was wondering if there are any plans to support
	    the Sun Classics or Sparcstation 5's?

	4.  We have very many SGI Indigo and Indy machines just lying idle.
	    Any idea if plan 9 runs on the Indigo Boxes? I know that it runs
	    on the SGI Challenge XL's.  We have them, but my hope was that
	    Challenge's also imply support for Indigos ;)

	5.  Anyone use plan 9 as a general environment for classes?  If 
	    you do, would you mind sharing some tips/tricks?

    I have the official annoucement from Sun about their new workstations
(Sun Sparcstation 5 and 20's).  The Classic has been reduced to $3k and 
the new sparcstation 5 comes in at around $4k (with half a gig of disk, 
16 meg of ram, monitor et al, 70 mz uSparc-II).  If anyone is interested, 
I can mail it out individually.  It was also posted to 
comp.sys.sun.hardware. 

Sorry to be asking so many (to some, stupid) questions, but I get only 
one shot at making plan 9 a part of our environment and I've had to call 
in a lot of favors for this one.

i did that a few months ago.  it only supports ISA at the moment
(i haven't got an EISA yet to try), and thus only 16 Mbytes
since i don't compensate for the limitations of the pc's DMA addressing.
(it wouldn't be too hard: the SCSI adapter could allocate some
space below 16meg and copy the data; whether that's sensible
is another matter.)

i run the file server on a 16Mb 486sx33 with an Ultrastor 14F
and two Fujitsu SCSI-2 drives.  (it boots from a floppy.)
the ethernets supported are those supported by the cpu/terminal kernel
and also NE2100 clones, which use the AMD Lance
(another device with addressing problems!).
the 486sx33 serves a 486dx2-66 CPU server and a few terminals.
i can't compare its performance to an SS2; i improvised
a bootstrap for Plan 9 that went straight to the pc via 9sscd.

the only host adapter supported is the Ultrastor 14F.  the driver should
work with the 34F with at most minor changes, if any, but my 34F
and not-quite-VESA motherboard don't agree, so i haven't been able to test it.
a bus-mastering VESA device can avoid the 16Mb DMA restrictions, however,
making an ISA/VESA pc more useful as a file server.
i have an Adaptec 1542B/Bustek 542B driver, but it doesn't drive discs
(it runs the 1542B in target mode, not initiator mode);
still, most of what is required is there.

Subject: about your music..



Hi, 
We've been checking out music sites and music pages and we want to invite
you to start a free artist page on the fastest growing music site on the
web. This site is simply like no other. 
IACmusic.com is an indie all-star site, it recently got mention in
Rolling Stone, and has been called the online world's most innovative
music portal.  We reach out to bring in artists who are truly creative
with influences vast.  Cashbox found the quality of music on the site so
outstanding that now all content on their Indie Charts comes directly
from IAC.   Our traffic is huge and growing, word of mouth is off the
hook, and our station set-up is years beyond any other music site. 
Meanwhile, our community is thriving with station managers who actively
pounce on the new releases and will help promote your songs for you.
Also, IAC stations will soon be available to listen to via any cellphone
with our recent move into that arena. 
We are about the music and indie culture.   No cookie-cutters were used
in the making of this site.  IAC is colorful and magical, to reflect the
creativity of the artists themselves.  If you choose, you can sell your
downloads, set your own price and you get 100% of the take.  You can
build digital CDs called DMDs which include the revolutionary IAC
Ultrapage.  IAC's dedicated support department is always there to answer
your questions.  Check out the site here.  If you want to find real
listeners, this is the place to do it. 
Here's a direct shortcut to start a free page.  Any additional exposure
will help you get your music to the world. 
Hope to hear your songs at IAC soon! 
Toby, a&r - IACmusic.com

I managed to get access to the Vista system again.  The changes that have been
made to Samba recently *do* appear to have solved the problems with accessing
Vista.  I'm now able to both enumerate shares and access files on the Vista
machine that was inaccessible during my initial tests.

Interestingly, it's now negotiating NTLMSSP just like it does with W2k, which
it was not doing in my previous tests.

Anyway, it seems that the big problem I thought we had doesn't exist.  That's
nice to know.

Cheers,

Derrell

PRODUCTS AND
PROJECTS
 [01] Paragent 3.0
(upgrade) 
If your upstart is too small to have its own IT administrator, Paragent has
a product for you.  Paragent 3.0 is an open-source, SaaS-based IT
management application that provides real-time, on-demand data and
information about a company's networked computers.  The new release adds
automatic software and inventory collection, advanced search and remote
desktop functionality. Paragent claims to be one of the few SaaS companies
pursuing an open source strategy. http://www.paragent.com

Linspire's Custom OS Build Service (new service)
Our friends at Linspire continue to find new niches, the latest being a
custom desktop Linux OS Build Service for its partners. The new
custom-build service is designed to help those partners not only to get the
exact feature sets they want but also cut their time to market and reduce
the expense involved in building a desktop Linux operating system.  One can
build a Debian or Ubuntu-based desktop Linux OS with customizable software
stacks and other features. http://www.linspire.com
 [03]
PostgreSQL 8.3 (update)
The PostgreSQL team is beamingly proud of the new Version 8.3 of the
popular high-performance, object-relational database management system. 
Version 8.3 is said to provide greater consistency of performance than
previous editions, ensuring that every user can depend on the same high
performance demonstrated in recent benchmarks for every transaction. Other
enhancements include over 280 patches, Heap Organized Tuples, spread
checkpoints, background writer autotuning and asynchronous commit option -
all of which accelerate transaction processing throughput between 5-30%. 
Many new features are included for application developers, as well. 
PostgreSQL is available for download from the organization's Web site.http://www.postgresql.org
 [04] Permabit Enterprise Archive
Data Center Series  (new product line)
Heads up storage hounds, Permabit recently released Permabit Enterprise
Archive Data Center Series, a line of scalable data-reduced storage
solutions for enterprise archiving.  Permabit's proposition is that 60-80%
of data in the data center is static and sits on expensive,
transaction-optimized primary storage.  Their solution is to move large
volumes of static data to more cost-effective tiers with the same level of
assurance as primary storage.  The solutions scale up to 3 PB and offer
costs ranging from $0.33 to $2.33 per GB of storage, vs. $25 to 75 per GB
for competing archiving solutions, claims Permabit.  Permabit also says
that its new RAIN-EC data protection technology is 250 times safer than
RAID 6.  http://www.permabit.com

Summary: More resilient parsing for sb_imapfilter

Initial Comment:
On 31 January 2006 I posted this problem that came
up for me trying to do training with sb_imapfilter with the latest
CVS:

  Loading state from /usr/home/dave/hammie.new.db database
  /usr/home/dave/hammie.new.db is a new database

      for msg in self:

      yield self[key]
    File ""/usr/home/dave/src/spambayes/scripts/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 831, in __getitem__
      data = self.imap_server.extract_fetch_data(response_data)
    File ""/usr/home/dave/src/spambayes/scripts/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 455, in extract_fetch_data
      msg_data = self._extract_fetch_data(msg)
    File ""/usr/home/dave/src/spambayes/scripts/sb_imapfilter.py"", line 428, in _extract_fetch_data
      raise BadIMAPResponseError(""FETCH response"", response)
  __main__.BadIMAPResponseError: The command 'FETCH response' failed to give an OK response.
  (' UID 1967)',)

I decided last week to try to debug this a little bit myself.  I know
almost nothing about the workings of IMAP, but the problem appears to
be that sb_imapfilter isn't accounting for responses like this one:

  [
    (
      '6 (BODY[] {3130}'
    , 'Return-Path: <MAILER-DAEMON...about 3000 characters snipped...'
    ) 
  , ' UID 6)'
  ]


In particular, that last fragment is where sb_imapfilter gets upset.
I don't know whether the real bug is in whatever gets passed to
sb_imapfilter to be used as its ""server"" attribute, or whether it's
here, but if you look carefully at the response data structure above,
which is passed back from the server object to sb_imapfilter, you'll
see that the parenthesization that was in the original text coming
back from the real IMAP server (i.e. a computer) is ""violated"" by the
data structure, which leads me to believe that the problem might be in
whatever is parsing that response into the data structure (the server
object, I presume)... although I'm not sure what it is actually
supposed to be doing in this case, so it's hard to say

The following patch (which, given my scant knowledge, is almost
certainly wrong) makes the problem disappear for me.

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

==============================================================
                                      Port 80 is the new HTTP.
                             -- Jeremy Allison on Web Services
==============================================================
Release Announcements
=====================
This is the first release candidate of the Samba 3.0.25 code
base and is provided for testing only.  An RC release means
that we are close to the final release but the code may still
have a few remaining minor bugs.  This release is *not* intended
for production servers.  There has been a substantial amount
of development since the 3.0.23/3.0.24 series of stable releases.
We would like to ask the Samba community for help in testing
these changes as we work towards the next significant production
upgrade Samba 3.0 release.

Major features included in the 3.0.25 code base include:

  o Significant improvements in the winbind off-line logon support.
  o Support for secure DDNS updates as part of the 'net ads join'
    process.
  o Rewritten IdMap interface which allows for TTL based caching and
    per domain backends.
  o New plug-in interface for the ""winbind nss info"" parameter.
  o New file change notify subsystem which is able to make use of
    inotify on Linux.
  o Support for passing Windows security descriptors to a VFS
    plug-in allowing for multiple Unix ACL implements to running side
    by side on the Same server.
  o Improved compatibility with Windows Vista clients including
    improved read performance with Linux servers.
  o Man pages for VFS plug-ins.


Off-line Logons and AD Site Support
===================================

Winbind's capability to support offline logons has been greatly
improved with the 3.0.25 release including support for locating
domain controllers asynchronously using Active Directory Site
information.


New IdMap Interface for Winbindd
================================

The 3.0.25 release of Samba will include a rewritten IdMap interface
for winbindd which replaces the ""idmap backend"" parameter.  The
initial design document may be found at

	http://www.samba.org/~idra/samba3_newidmap.pdf

Please refer to the ""idmap domains"" description in the smb.conf(5)
man page for more details.


Dynamic DNS Updates
===================

The ""net ads join"" command is now able to register the host's DNS
A records with Windows 2000 SP4 and 2003 DNS servers.  This
feature must be enabled at compile time using the --with-dnsupdate
when running the ./configure script.  There is also a related ""net
ads dns"" command for refreshing a host's records which could be
launched from a dhcp client script when a new IP address is obtained.


Support for Additional ACL Modules
==================================

Samba's POSIX ACL support has been moved inside of the VFS layer
which means it is now possible to support multiple ACL implementations
on the same server including NFSv4 and GPFS ACLs.


VFS ReadAhead Plugin
====================

Windows Vista introduces pipe-lined read support for improved
performance when transferring files.  The new vfs_readahead plugin
allows Linux file servers to utilize additional Kernel buffers
for caching files in order to avoid Disk I/O wait time when serving
Vista clients.  If you experience poor read performance between
Linux servers and Vista clients, please test the vfs_readahead
module by adding the following lines to the share definition
in smb.conf:

[file_share]
	vfs objects = readahead

Note that this plugin will result in additional RAM requirements
due to the increased amount of kernel buffer caches used by smbd.
Please refer to vfs_readahead(8) for more information.

refrain from adding any comments, letting the listmembers interpret them
as they see fit.

But since you asked....

I chose to post this text simply because I thought it was a particularly

does anyone have any examples of ALEF code they might
share? (Or know of an FTP site?) It needn't be all that 
complex, just something to demonstrate the concurrency 
primitives. I intend to write a simple demonstration

Also, is SPARC and MIPS the only supported platforms?
Specifically, has anyone ported the compiler to the PC?

Any input is appreciated.

Overview:
       

Renewable Energy or “Green Power” is an exciting product or pricing program for utilities to offer their customers, but experience has shown that not all utilities enjoy huge successes with these programs. Customers respond favorably when green pricing products and programs are well designed and marketed. How can you ensure your green power pricing program is going to succeed to your expectations?
EUCI’s 4th Annual Marketing Green Power conference was designed for utilities seeking to shorten their learning curve on how to design and market their green power pricing programs. Our conference speakers represent market leaders, potential partners, and utilities that have pioneered green pricing programs. At this event, they share their experiences with program design, launch and adoption. Case study presentations reveal the challenges faced and how those hurdles were overcome.
Hear from utilities in the U.S. that are leaders of Green Energy Programs as they detail their marketing strategies, display marketing materials, and share their successes with you.
Attendees of This Conference Will Learn To:


Understand trends in utility green pricing programs

Utilize RECs as part of the procurement strategy in green pricing programs

Predict commercial performance as it relates to timing and technology

Learn how to leverage product labeling initiatives

Identify effective green power marketing messages

Increase participation rates in green power program adoption

Leverage the marketing power of commercial customers to spread the green power message

Communicate the value proposition of green power pricing to customers

          EUCI’s 4th Annual Marketing Green Power conference features interactive discussion on how to design your marketing program, partner with other firms and organizations, reach your target market, gain sign-ups and eventually offer premium customer service for this premium product offering. 

          It features executive level speakers with years of experience successfully leading their organizations to achieve the highest measures in green power programs.

Subject: debian.blueyonder.co.uk broken
Date: Wednesday 04 April 2007 00:55
From: adonikam@virgonet.org
To: debian-boot@lists.debian.org

The debian.blueyonder.co.uk mirror in the latest daily build (as of
03/04/07) of the etch installer is obsolete. The installer fails to
download initramfs-tools using this mirror (unauthenticated error).
Additionally, a 302 Found was encountered when manually running apt-get
update in the /target chroot. Once I changed this to
debian.virginmedia.com, as is correctly listed on the debian mirror list
(http://www.debian.org/mirror/mirrors_full), I could run apt-get update
and apt-get install initramfs-tools without problems. The installation
could not be completed as the
/etc/apt/sources.list file is overwritten on the ""Install Base System""
 step.

This needs to be fixed before etch is released.

>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on ""who can I work with"" and only
maybe 10% on ""how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?""

HELP!
I am looking for information on how to identify and quantify airborne
particlutes in lake sediment in a semi-arid region. Sedigraph results show a
bimodal distribution, largest mode in presumed runoff-borne clays, and
a very weak mode, during historic droughty periods, in the silt fraction.
The silt fraction is never more than ~5% of the total. How can I test if the
silt mode is aeolian? Please help!

You would need to set your system up to do this for you, possibly parsing logs
or some other MTA-related tool, but it's not a function that SA provides by itself.

However, since this isn't a bug in SpamAssassin, I'm going to close out this
ticket.  If you want to ask for help regarding this on the users@ list, please
feel free to do so.

At Usenix Rob was kind enough to let me play with acme (running on a

extensible to be able to do most of the interesting things that are
attractive about emacs.  It was pretty impressive, really.

Acme is extensible by using external agents, more like XEDIT and REXX
under VM/CMS than like emacs, actually.  So if someone ports a Scheme

only come in a few inflexible sizes.  I miss NeWS, where fonts were
nice scalable postscript objects. Second, they are hard to read.
(Especially on a 640x480 screen!) If pixmaps were used, the glyphs
could be anti-aliased, with grey pixels smoothing out the jaggies.  To
see what a big difference this makes in apparent resolution, look at
the output of a recent version of xdvi.  It's not a frill, but a
qualitative improvement in, well, quality.

Clarissa - Thanks so much for all your help with this pipe!  Everything looks great.  I just have a couple of paths
that I need to finish it:

January 2000 - I need deal #854688 pathed for EPGT and for TETC.  According to the invoice, we should have
                      11,129 dth on the interconnect.

February 2000 - I need deal #871184 pathed for HPL and CHAN.  HPL should have 3,600 dth and CHAN should
                       have 11,500 dth on the interconnect.

July 2000 - Deal #871172 has an interconnect issue.  According to MOPS contract #105124, they received 8,275 dth
                 on the Matagorda 624, but according to EPGT, they delivered 10,362 dth to HPL (?)  Could this possibly
                 need to be split somehow, or do you have any other ideas?

Let me know.  Thanks, Gloria 3-7118

You choose to have your email client do that.  You don't have to.  Short
of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.

An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  
If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.

The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --
maybe -- Palladium.

but clobbering some of the topic libraries didn't help matters. It
showed the same symptoms on reboot. (No X start, occasional screen
blanking, and ""Id 3 spawning too fast"".)

 I'm not sure how to ""capture"" log and get it to the world; apparently
my olpc can't see the network to scp anything. The best I can do is
page through it and get screen captures. Should I do that?

Since I'm an olpc novice and not a Linux expert I am probably not the
person to work this out. I really have very little idea what to expect
when it does work. And it appears that others are having problems with
385 on OS X.

Can you refer us to an earlier build known to work on Parallels? I'd
like to be able to touch Sugar before Wednesday.

i have a couple of questions regarding sasl.

In main.cf i have:

smtpd_recipient_restrictions=permit_mynetworks,permit_sasl_authenticated,reject_unauth_destination

verify_login=reject_sender_login_mismatch

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in my_domains:

mydomain1 verify_login
mydomain2 verify_login
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using this configuration user1@mydomain1 cannot pretend he is a 
different user. For example, he cannot send an email saying he is 
user2@mydomain2.

Question1: How can i exclude a user from this rule based on his IP? in 
main.cf i've added: mynetworks=127.0.0.1, his_ip_address but it does not 
work.

Question2: The rule above works fine for all users when they use a 
webmail client or any other client. The only problem is with users who 
use squirrelmail. They still can send emails with a fake ""from address""! 
Postfix cannot stop them.

Any ideas?

Thanks in advance,

Alex

Well, since several people have asked, I've included our diffs (with
explanations) to u9fs at the end of this message.  Note that they are
not quite the same as the Bell Labs diffs that Rob mailed out awhile
back--I had already discovered and fixed some of the problems
independently.

Most things I've tried seem to work Ok; the exception is the postscript
interpreter psi, which crashes for me on both the Sparc and the 68020,
in apparently the same way.  I have not put any deep debugging effort
into it.  Also, psi worked fine when I tried it on a 486 using kfs.
So I suspect psi may be interacting with u9fs in some strange way.

As for how I originally got Plan 9 up and working on a sparc
without a fileserver and without bootp, roughly:

0.  compiled u9fs on some convenient unix box; install in inetd.conf.
    contrary to the README in the u9fs source directory, plan 9 expects
    to find u9fs on port 564 (see /lib/ndb/local on the cdrom).
1.  boot plan9 off the cdrom
    i actually put the sparc/9sscd kernel in the SunOS root directory and
    used ""b sd()9sscd"".
2.  manually configure the network with ipconfig
3.  use ""srv tcp!1.2.3.4"" and then ""mount -c /srv/tcp!1.2.3.4 /n/kremvax""
    to get the Unix system mounted on /n/kremvax.  used /n/kremvax as
    a scratch area to build a modified kernel.
4.  the kernel sources are in /sys/src/9.
    i looked at /sys/src/9/boot/ip.c, which uses bootp to get various
    information, and used it as a prototype for a new boot method which
    asks the user to manually enter all that information.
    then, i used the ""/sys/src/9/ss/sscd"" configuration as a prototype
    to create a new ""ssuo"" configuration, and built my modified kernel
    with ""mk 'CONF=ssuo'"" in the ss/ directory.

Disclaimer: as with all free advice, this is worth what it cost.
These things worked for me, but I didn't keep notes and so this is
all from 6-month-old memory.  Similar disclaimer applies to the u9fs
diffs below.


Here are our patches for u9fs; they do the following things:

* fix a bug in the handling of seek offsets
* set the qid.version field from the stat.st_mtime field, rathern than 0.
  this makes executable caching work correctly.
* hacks to increase the descriptor table size limit under
  SunOS (#define DTABLE) and Dynix/PTX (#define SETDTABLESIZE).  this is
  important since plan 9 keeps open file descriptors to recently
  used executables, and without this change u9fs quickly runs out
  of descriptors.
* a hack to make u9fs work correctly with the Dynix/PTX inetd,
  and perhaps other System V.3 implementations as well (#define TIRDWR).
* a hack to make Plan 9 systems get the right system date when booting.
  Plan 9 gets the system date from the access time of ""/"".  therefore,
  we read ""/"" before accepting any requests from the remote Plan 9.
* implement the ORCLOSE remove-on-close option used by Plan 9 programs
  that create temporary files.

Right you are.  The SRPM includes a patch to enable it, but then the
specfile defaults to not applying that patch.  I saw the former but
missed the later.  Egad, what a convoluted maze.

Sorry for the misinformation!

Gary Capell <gary@cs.su.OZ.AU>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Mon, 07 Feb 1994 20:23:48 -0500","Re: SCSI support for PC, file server?","So does someone have a PC running as a file server somewhere?
If it's possible to get a Plan9 cpu server, file server and terminal
with three off-the-shelf PCs, it expands the possible market
enormously, I think, which means more developers, which means more
software, and support for more hardware, which expands the market,
which...oh who am I kidding?

I didn't even know anyone was working on such a thing.  I'd hate
for there to be duplication of effort, there's too much to do.
I think we're fast approaching the time we need an FTP site to
store our various hacks.  Also, perhaps people should post to
this list what s'ware they have written, and what they are in the
process of or planning on writing.  We can avoid duplication,
maybe even cooperate.

BTW, are there dangers or complications with sharing?  What
does a license restrict you from sharing with the world?
What if your code is mostly derived from Bell Labs source?
Is there a danger of diverging Plan 9 versions, a la Unix?
I think my ideal would be an ftp site of various drivers,
ports, and apps which would be treated as beta test, with
the working drivers and ports, and apps WORTH cluttering
up the name space/disk space, selected by Bell Labs and
added to the next distribution.

Thoughts?  And what are _you_ working on/thinking of working on?

BTW, I have a munged version of help(1) that lets you use
the view key and has some acme(1) features, i.e. click
button 3 on a filename to open, current directory state
associated with each window.  If anyone wants it, I'm
not sure what I'm allowed to do, but _I_ certainly don't
mind sharing :-).

Subject: Ad Hoc Timeline Review Team

Mark -

The ad hoc team's product is attached.  It is a suggested revision to the
NERC A3A1 time table for the WSCC.  Some basic points are:

*	Elimination of manually setting the WSCC pre-schedule flag.  The
table provides rules for the e-tag software to automatically set the flag.

*	The majority of our efforts were focussed on creating an incentive
mechanism to encourage timely tag submission and assessment.  The team
agreed that the best incentive mechanism would be a financial one (i.e.,
tags submitted close to the deadline would pay a high submittal fee - tags
submitted early in the hour would pay little or no submittal fee - approval
entities would receive compensation for assessing/approving late tags,
etc.).  But, a financial mechanism would  have to go through a cumbersome
review/approval process which would be too inflexible for the fast paced
world of E-Tag and NERC's electronic scheduling.  So, the suggested
incentive process increases the risk of a tag not being approved the closer
the submittal time is to the start time.  To do this, we considered three
parameters - the assessment window, deferred denial, and the default
composite status.  

	*	The assessment window is a period time that the E-Tag
Authority Service gives the Approval Services to assess a submitted tag.
Each Approval Service is to check the tag for various things and respond
with a approved or denied vote back to Authority service who then set the
final composite status.

	*	Deferred denial is when a entity denies a tag, the composite
status does not immediately become Denied, but instead waits until the end
of the assessment window to set the composite status.  This allows the
denying approval entity time to reconsider their vote and change it, if
appropriate.

	*	The default composite status is a final stated reached at
the end of the assessment window when one or more approval entities fails to
actively approve or deny a tag.  Currently, tags submitted before a certain
deadline will have their final composite status default to Approved.  Tags
submitted after a certain deadline will have their final composite status
default to Denied.

	For real-time tagging, we cite the hour-ahead business where
Purchasing-selling entities trade products for delivery in the next hour.  

	*	Tags submitted in the first half of the hour-ahead, referred
to 0 to 30 past, will have a 10 minute assessment window, are subjected to
deferred denial, and will default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted from 30 to 40 past, will have a 10 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and but will still default to Approved/Conditional.

	*	Tags submitted in the after 40 past, will have a 5 minute
assessment window, are not subjected to deferred denial (can be called
instant denial), and will default to Denied (thus assigned a composite
status of Late).

*	The table references specific times in the submittal and assessment
process which should all reference a consistent time zone standard.  The
team was divided on the best approach.  Some suggested all times on the
table be the prevailing time for the LCA.  This would require each CA to
include in the e-tag registry their time zone.  Some suggested  all times on
the table be in Pacific Prevailing Time.  And some suggested that all times
on the table be in Pacific Standard Time.  The conclusion is that a white
paper would be produced prior to the July ISAS meeting discussing the pros
and cons of each suggestion.

*	The group does not recommend basing submittal time on the tag
agent's time clock - submittal time should stay with the authority service.

*	Here's a big one - because the timing table allows for later
submittal times, the tag assessment process is encroaching on the start of
the WSCC standard ramp (i.e., currently starts at 10 minutes before the
hour).  We are recommending that ISAS request the OC to study the
feasibility of moving the WSCC standard ramp from a twenty minute duration
straddling the hour to 10 minute duration straddling the hour (i.e., starts
at 0:55 and ends at 0:05).  Such a change would align the WSCC with the
Eastern Interconnection and relieve some of the issues surrounding late tag
submittals.

*	There was some discussion on establishing a new regional practice
for the tariff deadline for schedule changes (most are set to 20 before the
start).  It was felt that there is little chance at getting all entities to
change their tariffs in a coordinated and timely manner.

*	The team did not want to address at this time issues concerning
multiple preschedule days and how they are not recognized in Policy 3 or the
E-Tag specifications.

*	Finally, the team can not stress enough that a composite status of
Late should not and does not mean automatic denial.  The Late designation
simple indicates that the default composite status is Denied.  Approval
entities should make every effort to assess all tags, Late or not.

Hurray for the team members, many, many thanks.

That's where the ""1 hit"" comes from (obviously).  The version of nmh I'm
using is ...

delta$ pick -version

And the relevant part of my .mh_profile ...

delta$ mhparam pick

Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the
one that's explicit on the command line, from the search popup, and the
one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

been able to reach the cvs repository today (local routing issue I think).

Hi, Ben,

it seems, the RH freetype package should be repacked,
see for this
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=74415

Please, can you atach and send your sucessfully rebuild of the RH freetype
rpm with the bytecode enabled to me?

                      SALTATION VIDEO

Dear Colleague,

During the 'Response of Eolian Processes to Global Change' Conference at
Zzyzx, California in March this year, I showed a video compiled from some
of our high-speed cine-films.  The films were taken by a group in the
Department of Engineering of Aberdeen University, Scotland, who are
interested in saltation collisions.  They show sand grains saltating over
a granular bed in a wind tunnel, and focus on their interaction with the
surface rather than looking at the trajectories.  Individual collisions are
seen because (i) the film is run at 3000 frames per second and (ii) the
number of saltating grains is less than found in natural conditions.

At the meeting several people expressed interest in the video as a teaching
aid.  I have therefore added a few graphics to explain modes of transport
and the experimental setup.

If you are interested in purchasing the video, it is available from me,

The cost in the USA and Canada is 40 pounds + 5-60 pounds post and packing
= 46-60 pounds (to be paid in pounds sterling to 'The University of
Aberdeen (Engineering Department)'.

Postage to other countries will be different and there may be tax in Europe
and the UK, but I will be happy to quote you the appropriate rate.

If possible, we would prefer the money upfront, but I know that this may be
difficult.

The video is very much an amateur production, so don't expect a polished
professional product!  It has been produced solely as a teaching aid, so
that students can see the saltation process in action.

I look forward to hearing from you if you are intested in the video.

Yours sincerely

Ann Rice

Steve Kotsopoulos <steve@ecf.toronto.edu>,9fans@cse.psu.edu,"Mon, 13 Jun 1994 23:30:18 -0400",summary of Plan 9 BOF (birds of a feather session),"I scheduled a Plan 9 BOF at the Usenix conference last week.
About 40 people attended, but only a few had Plan 9.
Many of the others were either from commercial organizations
(and wish they could get it), or from universities without licences.
We were pleased that Rob Pike and Dennis Ritchie were able to attend.

I started the BOF by telling people how they could obtain licences, and
pointed them to the ftp archive on research.att.com for more information.
I also said that I was thinking of setting up my own ftp server, to
collect sources from the user community. I feel there may be some users
out there who have written software, but haven't made it available
to others because they don't have an anonymous ftp server.

If anyone has something they would like to make available to all the
other Plan 9 licencees, please send me mail. I'll post a notice to 
this list once the ftp service is online.

After the preliminary remarks, Rob Pike was kind enough to answer
a wide variety of questions. I'll summarize what I remember:

A new Plan 9 distribution will be worked on this summer, but it is unclear
if it will be distributed. Please don't deluge the developers for more
information regarding the licencing and release details.

It will have acme and a fax service, and updated versions of alef, acid &
authenticaion services.  The PC kernel now supports sound boards.
The default porting base will be for PC's instead of Sparcs and Magnums.
If legal details can be worked out, the Plan 9 developers hope that this
CD will also be released publicly, so that anyone can buy it
(again, this is what they HOPE ... no promises).

Brazil is their current research project. It looks like Plan 9 on the
outside, but there have been many internal changes. Most importantly,
the kernel data paths have been shortened to improve throughput.
Rob re-wrote the window system for Brazil in alef (in 4 days).

Someone asked ""why do we need another new language [alef]?""
Rob explained that alef is a concurrent object-oriented language,
and this makes it much easier to write some kinds of programs.
Two examples were given.  The fax package has a coroutine that loads
the next page of fax while you are reading the current page. This
was relatively easy to add in with alef.
Also, for programs like the window system, which manage several different
input and output devices, alef makes the program smaller and easier
to write (once you've mastered concurrent programming).

A new audio compression algorithm has been developed by the acoustics
researchers at Bell Labs. It gives 13:1 compression (mpeg gives 4:1).
A new network has been developed by Phil Winterbottom.
It is called Planet (built with PLA's), and can handle 300Mb/s.

Many of the questions had to do with licencing ... I don't recall
any details other than what I have already written.

The flexibility provided by virtualization introduces several
challenges and places a burden on storage. If your servers are
virtualized, but your storage is still physically attached, you
haven't improved much. 

This white paper explains how virtual SAN storage with automatic load
balancing can provide flexible and fluid virtualization
implementation. Read this white paper to discover: 

** Considerations when selecting virtualization technologies 
** The importance of iSCSI when enabling virtual machines to be on
   a SAN
** A checklist for evaluating a Virtual Server/Virtual Storage 
   solution

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to
postscript and png.  You could also try openoffice and/or abiword if you
have x installed.

Indirectly. Use a transport_maps entry to deliver mail through a
non-default mail delivery transport in master.cf, then set a
(transport name)_destination_concurrency_limit for that.

Just clone the ""smtp ... smtp"" line and give it a different
name in the first field, then ""postfix reload"".

Looks to me like you were running 1.5.2 for a while, then lately, you
upgraded it.  You need to re-run the config/conf.pl utility, and
simply save your settings again.  That will correct the problem.

New Revision: 22132

WebSVN: http://websvn.samba.org/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi?view=rev&root=samba&rev=22132

Log:
I hate inefficiency. Don't call conv_str_size()
on every pread/sendfile call, initialize these
variables in an allocated struct at connection
time and just refer to them directly.
Jeremy.

I should clarify this:  In Unix, most programs take standard input
and produce standard output.  The same is true in Plan 9.  So when
I said the plan 9 model is mostly the same, I was thinking of how
you run programs, not how you write them.  The incompatibilities
are a bit more dramatic from a programmer's point of view.

I am writing some code to obtain publication-like plots (like the ones can

need to know the exact dimension (in relative coordinates :

Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity  
            
Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

Tom Cruise Set to Play Nazi

Cruise Set to Play Nazi







AP


Tom Cruise




There are bad ideas in Hollywood, and then there are bad ideas. Kevin Costner as a futuristic water avenger with gills? Terrible. Demi Moore as a stripper? Yikes. Tom Cruise as a samurai? Even worse. 


But no one says no in Hollywood when a star says yes. So Cruise, unable to stop his career suicide, has picked one more impossible mission: He is set to play a Nazi who tried but failed with a group of other resistors to assassinate Adolf Hitler in 1944.
The character, if depicted correctly, will have a heavy German accent. He will also have lost his left eye, his right hand and the fourth and fifth fingers of his left hand by the time of the film's climax. He will then be murdered by Hitler.
You had me at ""Auf Wiedersehen.""
Cruise's desire to play this hotsie-totsie Nazi � to quote a Mel Brooks line from ""The Producers"" � is questionable at best. Germany, which does not like Scientology and has banned it, gives him a tough time whenever he goes there to promote a film.
It can't be too far from Cruise's calculating mind to think that by playing a man who some Germans consider a hero, he'll win over the country.
But the family of the man he wants to play feel very much otherwise.
Relatives of Count Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg � who led the Operation Valkyrie assassination plot � recently told the Scotsman newspaper that they weren't so excited about Cruise playing someone so famous that a street is even named for him and a museum commemorates the resistors.
Cruise, many feel, has selected the material as a way of reversing his and Scientology's negative standing in the country.
""I have nothing against him [Cruise] and can even separate his work from his beliefs in Scientology,"" the soldier's grandson, Count Caspar Schenk von Stauffenberg, told the paper. ""But I and other family members are worried that the picture will be financed by the sect and be used to get across its propaganda.
""Unfortunately the family Stauffenberg can do nothing about this,"" he continued. ""My grandfather is a figure from history.""
The Stauffenbergs are also staunch Catholics, which doesn't help matters. Cruise has renounced Catholicism for Scientology, pulling with him all the members of his family, including his mother.
""You can be Catholic and a Scientologist,"" Cruise told one interviewer in 2005. ""We are just Scientologists.""
Unlike in America, where Scientology became a church and earned tax-free status, in Germany it's a different story. The country does not acknowledge what they call a ""fake religion."" Germans believe Scientology is on a financial, rather than spiritual, mission.
Stauffenberg joined a group of conspirators in 1944 who participated in Operation Valkyrie. They wanted to take down Hitler not because of the Holocaust or any other horror in particular, just because they felt he was destroying Germany's legacy.
According to many published reports, Stauffenberg wrote to his wife, Nina, that Poland contained ""many Jews, many people of mixed blood ... who are only happy when they are dominated.""
Nevertheless, Stauffenberg managed to plant a bomb in a briefcase near Hitler during a military meeting on July 20, 1944. It exploded, killing several officers. But a large oak table in the room saved Hitler.
Stauffenberg was caught and executed that night, as were 7,000 other sympathizers. Some were said to have been strangled with piano wire. Hitler had the whole thing filmed and watched it later in a screening room.
That would be the final scene in a movie neither you, nor I, want to see.
Paula Zahn: Who Wants to Be a Billionaire?
CNN's Paula Zahn, if you haven't heard, is in the middle of a messy divorce. Her wealthy husband, a Boston real-estate developer named Richard Cohen, cut her loose when he discovered her affair with another man.
Well, Paul J. Fribourg is not just your average ""other guy."" He is a multibillionaire. Strangely, little has been written about him over the years. And yet, Fribourg is a name worth knowing.
His company, ContiGroup, was known as Continental Grain for many decades. They are one of the international leaders in global agribusiness, controlling most pork and poultry production and cattle feeding in the world. The whole world. And they've been doing this for more than 150 years.
Indeed, the Belgian-bred Fribourgs are one of the wealthiest families in the world. Paul Fribourg, now 53, took over the company a dozen years ago from his father, Michel.
Michel Fribourg died in 2001 at age 87. In his New York Times obit, he was described as ""the premier figure in world trade in food of the 20th century.''
We are not talking Donald Trump here. This is a world of money by far unknown to you and me, hence, the secrecy. Until this business with Paula Zahn, the Fribourgs were notable for never getting any publicity. But they would be a great subject for a multigenerational saga and movie.
Michel Fribourg's grandfather, Simon, started the company in Belgium in 1813. He moved it to Paris, but escaped World War II by moving again to America in 1940. Simon's son, Jules, took over and made even more money.
But it was Michel who opened up trade in 1964 with the Soviet Union. He convinced Richard Nixon to let him do more business there in 1972 and sold the Russians 10 billion tons of grain.
Nevertheless, Paul Fribourg is a huge Democratic donor, giving as much as he can � hundreds of thousands of dollars according to public records � to every Democratic candidate, including New York senators Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer. He also gave $37,000 to the campaign of New York's new governor, Eliot Spitzer.
In the 2006 cycle, the Fribourgs (including Paul, wife Josabeth and brother Charles) donated $81,000 to Democratic causes, including $45,000 to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
The Fribourgs are also charitable, giving away about $1 million a year to various groups. And while they are wealthy beyond almost definition, it's unclear how Paul Fribourg has fared as head of the company. He advised his father to sell the grain operation to their competitor, Cargill, in 1994. According to the New York Times, his father only agreed when he was assured his employees would be safe.
When Paul Fribourg took over completely in 1996, and he immediately ramped up a division called ContiFinancial, which dealt in subprime lending on mortgages and leases.
Within two years there was trouble, and by the end of 1999 ContiFinancial � with no mention of Fribourg attached � had filed for bankruptcy. They claimed more than $1.3 billion in debt, including $700,000 to Norwest Bank of Minnesota. They wound up laying off 2,700 employees before disappearing entirely in 2001.
Fribourg now runs ContiGroup, a spin-off of the original company. He sits on the boards of Vivendi Universal, The Public Theater and Loews Corporation. He and his Moroccan-born wife, Josabeth, live in a palatial townhouse near the Guggenheim Museum with their seven children.
On the ContiGroup's Web site, Fribourg concludes his CEO's letter saying that he's excited about: ""forging strong partnerships and moving ahead in promising new directions.""
Will they be with Paula Zahn? The betting money says no, a divorce would come at an astronomical price. But then again stranger things have happened.
Tomorrow: A quiz! (Just kidding!)
TV Notes: Sunday Surprises
Yes, that was Dave Brubeck's jazz classic, ""Take Five,"" playing in the background as counterpoint to Tony and Bobby's fight last night on ""The Sopranos.""
And then on top of it, Tony was singing The Drifters' ""Under the Boardwalk."" Brilliant. ...
And Margot Kidder is back, playing Sally Field's wacky friend on ""Brothers & Sisters."" Nice to see her. ...
Edward Mallory died over the weekend. The genial 76-year-old actor was the original star of ""Days of Our Lives,"" the NBC soap, when creators Ted and Betty Corday knew how to write a story for good actors. He will be missed. ...
If you liked ""Entourage"" last night, the next two episodes are just as funny and smooth. Next week, real-life movie producer Joel Silver gets a credit for making an appearance and not saying a word of dialogue. That's why he's Joel Silver. ...

I would like to thank everyone that contributed to the Beach Bowl 2001 for ALS.  My grandmother passed away from this debilitating disease in 1986 and since then there has been only one small breakthrough in the treatment.  Hopefully with your donations and those of others we can make a difference for those suffering from ALS. It means a great deal to me that you were able to help out even though the event was so far away from Portland. Thank you again for your support and I miss everyone.

It's Christmas break (unless you have a real job) and I figured why not
try this.  I worked with what you had.  There were a few little things I
cleaned up but the major flaw was not in the Icon.  This program didn't
work with n larger than 2.  That's not an Icon problem but what the heck.
It's been a while since I worried about boolean anything but I took a
shot.  I also made it possible to pass in a larger n to verify the
changes worked.  I didn't include the original program so dig up the
earlier mail for comparison.

McCain insists 'signs of progress' in Iraq

04/09/07 08:50 PM, EDT
A day after the broadcast of an interview in which he admitted overstating security advances in Baghdad, U.S. Sen. John McCain said Monday that he still believes the Iraq war is winnable and ""unfortunately, the American people are not being told of the progress that's being made"" there.

From: 	Comnes, Alan

Subject:	DWR Stranded Cost Update

Using information pulled together by Jennifer and BAN, I requested West Tradings Risk/Structuring Group do a more careful analysis of the above-market costs associated with the DWR contracts.  Attached is their analysis.

In this analysis we examined only the executed contracts and NOT the agreements-in principle.  (Only executed contracts were released by the state in the last few weeks.) Also, gas-indexed contracts were examined on their nongas costs only.  Since gas costs are a pass through on some contracts, we excluded them as a conservatism; i.e., we did not ascribe costs to the gas portion of the contracts since they will float with market costs over time.  These contracts were marked to market using current, applicable curves.  Finally we discounted at the LIBOR rate, which is around 4%/year.

The stranded cost under these assumptions  is approximately $10 billion.  The spreadsheet shows the overmarket costs by contract.  Note: a negative ""mark-to-market"" equals a positive stranded cost.

As before, this analysis is based upon Enron's confidential forward curves.  Approval from Tim Belden is needed before this analysis can be released.

Here is a summary of comments from sa-dev that should be here for the record:

  -----------

Michael Parker said:

Would anyone object to removing .so from this list?  The .so TLD is  
basically dead and we've found that lots of bogus domains like lib*.so  
are being caught by this.  Also sometimes you'll have spammers who are  
putting in gibberish or funny punctuation and you'll get sentences  
like 'blah blah.So this is'.  It also occurs with a couple of other  
domains but .so is by far the worst.

For more info on the .so domain you can read about it here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.so_%28domain_name%29

 ------------

To which I replied:

After reading the Wikipedia entries for the TLDs that they list as unused, I
would be in 
favor of removing all of them

  bv gb pm sj so um yt

If spammers can't use them as domains, then all including them could do would be to 
generate false positives.

The three listed as ""phaseout"", su tp yu, on the other hand, I would keep,
because it 
appears from the Wikipedia articles that they are in active use either during a
transition 
period or because their phaseout is being resisted.

If we can reach consensus on this, I'll make the changes to the code I committed.

And then Justin Mason said:

I'm happy enough with that. btw this discussion should be on

Dear CNET members,


Happy Friday! It's good to be back from a long weekend in Vegas. I had a blast there--not only was the Super Bowl a great game all way to the last minute, but also I was able to do a lot of other things like celebrate a friend's birthday, and a friend's bachelor party, and even got to go see a live Ultimate Fighting Championship match! Talk about a fun filled guy's weekend The only downside, was while my mind helped me feel like I was 21 again, my body said, ""No way buddy!"" So I'm still recovering, but it was well worth it. Now it's back to being a daddy, and husband again. OK, enough about my weekend. Let's get started with Richard's question of how he can remove his hard drive partition.    

This week we received more than 60 submissions to Richard's question in regards to removing his hard drive partition. After reading all the answers, a huge percentage of you recommended a utility called Symantec's Norton Partition Magic to get the job done (second most mentioned was Acronis Disk Director Suite 10.0). While I have never tried any of these utilities, I've always heard good things about them and how simple they are to use. However, these utilities don't come free, and will set you back some money. But if time is money, and the fastest way to get around this issue is to fork out some dough, I would buy it. So to get you started here are a few selected submissions for you to get going. But please, read through the other members' submissions. Some of you may come to realize that it might be worthwhile to wipe your hard drive clean and start over, or just to invest in a new hard drive all together. Before any of you do attempt to go through with this task, I would advise you to backup your data, just in case anything goes wrong. If you have any more questions, ask away. For those of you who have any other recommendations on this week's topic, join in on the discussion. Thank you for your contributions and have a wonderful weekend.

Member Question of the Week


When I originally set up my new computer four years ago, I
mistakenly partitioned the C drive too small.  Now, after
collecting many files, the C drive is more than 90 percent
full, making it difficult to operate.  I would like to remove
the partition and use the entire hard drive as the
C drive, giving 80GB total. The computer has a second hard
drive I use for storage of 250GB. How do I remove the
partition and still keep everything intact? What are my
options? Thanks so much for your help.  I am a retiree
working with genealogy and family history. I'm running
Windows XP. Thank you!

Hi everyone. I bought a Western Digital 200GB external hard
drive 90-plus days ago, and the buttons quit. I can't back 
up. I sent WD several e-mails, and no response from them. If
I get another external hard drive, could I open this one, and
transfer data to the new external one from the old? How would
I do this? Also: If this can be done, could the one I have
then be reformatted, put in a new casing? Does anyone know
how to repair these on/off/auto buttons? Will I lose
everything I backed up to the WD external drive?  Please keep
the explanation simple, as I'm a 63-year-old 'Nanny', IRS
Reg. Tax Preparer. Thank you!

Check out next week's question:


My computer Windows XP Home SP2 computer for 5 years has been getting slower and slower. I know my computer is not infected with spyware or viruses as I run a pretty tight ship when it comes to security. So what's next? I've always heard good things that can result from registry cleaners, but anytime some one mentions registry I cringe at the thought as I've heard that tweaking the Windows registry can easily go wrong and possibly kill my computer. Is this true? How about registry cleaners? Ultimately what can a registry cleaner do for me? Will I benefit from it? Is it safe? I think it time for me to face my fears with the registry. So can you kindly give me some pointers on the ins and outs about registry cleaners,  recommend some good ones that are free or paid, and what should I do to prepare myself for this task to ensure if I do decide to do some registry cleaning that I'm prepared for the worst to happen and recover gracefully. Thank for your advice!

Actually, there tends to be a continual stream of articles in the general
area -- not so much creation vs. evolution, but recent articles I recall
included critiques of Philip Johnson's book _Darwin_On_Trial_, discussions
of flood geology, and other things that were way over my head.  

Incidentally, the Journal of the ASA changed its name a few years back
and is now known as ""Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith""
or just ""Perspectives"".

ASA also puts out a booklet called ""Teaching Science in a Climate of
Controversy"", designed to be used as a supplement to high school courses
on evolution.  The point of the booklet is mainly that there are advocates
at both extremes of the controversy who are apt to practice bad science,
and that one must look critically at all claims in the field, regardless
of which position they advocate.

For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that

as an all round nice guy?

Pilgrim Reader - John & Sandy <pilgrimreader@nexicom.net>,bookscanada@ramsaybooks.com,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 12:50:10 -0400",[Bookscanada] Was a book written about this - - ?,"Good morning all,

A customer is looking for a book that may have been written about the disappearance in June of 1972, of a young boy (Adrian McNaughton) in the Holmes' Lake area of Brougham Township in Renfrew County (Ottawa Valley area of Ontario). He was 6 years old at the time.

She recalls having seen something about it in the past (other than printed news reports. Perhaps a bound official report? An article in a magazine?).

Any information or leads (even a ""yes - there is"" or ""no - there isn't"") would be much appreciated.

Kindest regards - John Lynch.

How about a feature to automatically set tuxonice userui depending if
FBSPLASH or BOOTSPLASH is enabled to tuxonice_fbsplash or _text?

Hangs for me even with glxgears running.  And it's during the writing of
the caches, so I don't know how it would be nvidia related...

Nigel, how can I get the log messages written out?  Disable the UI?

Lucky you!  The only way I have ever gotten the nvidia drivers to not
hang (using swsusp, tuxonice, uswsusp, whatever) is to use
suspend-to-ram after disabling whatever magic video card hackery the
distro tries (on the theory that the nvidia binary driver knows more
about the quirks my card has than the sleep scripts the distro uses).

That will get them displayed. Alternatively, you can just set the 
default console level higher than 1, or change it while hibernation is 
running. This assumes that you have PM_DEBUG enabled.

I've been working on the lowlevel code for writing the image and 
discovered one potential hang yesterday (now fixed). Perhaps this will 
turn out to be the cause of your woes.

TWO NLRB RULINGS ON ALLIEDSIGNAL REACH DIFFERENT RESULTS IN
D.C. CIRCUIT

In two decisions involving AlliedSignal's acquisition of
operations at an Army engine plant in Stratford, Conn., a
federal appeals court upholds a National Labor Relations
Board ruling that the company illegally terminated
collectively bargained severance benefits, but overturns a
separate board ruling that the company improperly ended a
side agreement.

The District of Columbia Circuit agrees with the board that
AlliedSignal, which has since been acquired by Honeywell
International Inc., committed an unfair labor practice by
unilaterally terminating severance benefits when an
agreement expired with the United Auto Workers regarding the
effects of AlliedSignal's acquisition (""Honeywell Int'l Inc.
v. NLRB, ""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1171, 6/29/01). Finding no
bargaining impasse or union waiver, the appeals court
decides AlliedSignal was barred from making unilateral
changes regarding severance benefits, a mandatory subject of
bargaining. The second ruling involves AlliedSignal's
termination of a competitiveness agreement containing job
protections. The appeals court decides the issue only
involves contract interpretation, which is for arbitrators
and the courts to decide (""Honeywell Int'l Inc. v. NLRB,
""D.C. Cir., No. 00-1170, 6/29/01). . . . Page AA-1

NURSING HOME WORKER WINS FMLA CLAIM, MAY PROCEED WITH ADA
SUIT

A Pittsburgh nursing home violated the Family and Medical
Leave Act when it fired a former assistant nursing director
who took medical leave after being diagnosed with clinical
depression, the U.S. District Court for the Western District
of Pennsylvania holds (""Wilson v. Lemington Home for the
Aged, ""W.D. Pa., No. 99-1893,  6/25/01).

Marva J. Wilson gave the Lemington Home for the Aged
adequate notice that she needed to take the leave, but the
employer failed to provide her with a written notice of her
legal obligations, the company's expectations of her under
its FMLA policy, and any consequence she might face for
failing to meet these expectations, Judge Ambrose rules,
granting Wilson summary judgment on her FMLA claims. Ambrose
also denies the employer's bid for summary judgment on
Wilson's claim that she was discriminated against in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act. . . . Page

OSHA PLANNING TO EXPAND INJURY SURVEY TO CONSTRUCTION IN
2002

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to
expand its mandatory injury survey in 2002 to target between
15,000 and 20,000 construction companies, OSHA officials
tell BNA. The expansion would represent the first look at an
industry that so far has eluded a data-gathering effort,
begun by the Clinton administration nearly five years ago.

The plan, which one OSHA source says will be outlined in a
""Federal Register"" notice slated for publication in late
July, is scaled back from a proposal unveiled a year ago to
survey about 56,000 construction companies in 2001. The
""Federal Register"" notice is expected to seek comments on
the proposal as the first formal step toward implementing
the construction survey. . . . Page A-3

NO ERISA BAR TO PHARMACIST'S STATE CLAIMS OVER CVS'S HIRING
DATE

Reversing a lower court,  the North Carolina Court of
Appeals finds no preemption under the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act on a pharmacist's state law action
alleging retail drug chain CVS breached a contract and
engaged in unfair and deceptive trade practices by selecting
an improper hire date for calculating his pension benefits
(""Vaughn v. CVS Revco D.S. Inc., ""N.C. Ct. App., No.
COA00-159, 7/3/01).

Pharmacist William Edward Vaughn's state law claims do not
attempt to require an employee benefit plan to provide
particular terms or to regulate the types of benefits the
plan must provide, the appeals court says.  Rather, Vaughn's
""claims simply seek to enforce, or secure compensation for
the breach of an alleged agreement as to the date of hire
for purposes of determining plaintiff's pension benefits,""
the court says.

 Vaughn was hired by Revco drug stores on Feb. 15, 1972; in
August 1995 CVS acquired Revco.  Vaughn alleged that CVS in
hiring him confirmed by letter that he would ""retain [his]
tenure showing a date of hire of February 15, 1972,"" and
""[a]ll benefits will be applicable per [his] tenure."" Vaughn
brought suit in a North Carolina state court, however, after
CVS agents later told him his pension benefits would be
calculated as of the date he was hired by CVS in 1995. . . .

CARPENTERS, MASON TENDERS NEGOTIATE FIVE-YEAR CONTRACTS IN
NEW YORK

New five-year collective bargaining agreements went into
effect July 1 for at least 19,000 union carpenters and mason
tenders in the five boroughs of New York City.

The Carpenters and Joiners District Council of New York and
Vicinity negotiated separate agreements with the Building
Contractors Association of New York and the Association of
Wall-Ceiling and Carpenters Contractors of Long Island and
New York City. Both agreements provide wage and fringe
benefit increases of $14.52 per hour over the contract term.
The agreements cover at least 9,000 workers.

BCA also concludes a separate five-year agreement with the
Mason Tenders District Council of the Laborers International
Union that provides wage and benefit increases totaling
$7.50 per hour over term for approximately 10,000 workers in
the five boroughs of New York City. . . . Page A-4

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

for me for porting a variety of unix programs to plan 9.

The most annoying aspect of the whole process is not porting C code,
but porting makefiles and the associated shell scripts.

To this end, I have ported the almquist /bin/sh from netbsd, and gnu
make.  Using these tools I have been able to configure and build a
variety* of gnu software right out of the box.  I've also ported the
pbmplus suite of bitmap tools, although that required some small
source changes.

In the process I've found a few bugs in the ape library; most notably
the wait() function does not return exit status correctly.  What I
think happened is the kernel recently started putting the string
""<program>:"" into the exit status, and the ape library has not been
updated to know this.

I eventually (september or october) will make all this stuff
available to others, but right now my time is limited.

Millions With Chronic Disease Get Little to No Treatment 
By _REED ABELSON_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/a/reed_abelson/index.html?inline=nyt-per) 
 
Millions of Americans with chronic disease like _diabetes_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/diabetes/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)  
or _high blood pressure_ 
(http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/hypertension/overview.html?inline=nyt-classifier)  are not getting adequate 
treatment because they are among the nation’s growing ranks of uninsured.  
That is the central finding of a new study to be published Tuesday in the 
medical journal Annals of Internal Medicine. 
The study, the first detailed look at the health of the uninsured, estimates 
that about one of every three working-age adults without insurance in the 
United States has received a diagnosis of a chronic illness. Many of these people 
are forgoing doctors’ visits or relying on emergency rooms for their medical 
care, the study said.  
The report, based on an analysis of government health surveys of adults ages 
18 to 64 years old, estimated that about 11 million of the 36 million people 
without insurance in 2004 — the latest year of the study — had received a 
chronic-condition diagnosis.  
“These are people who, with modern therapies, can be kept out of trouble,” 
said Dr. Andrew P. Wilper, the study’s lead author. Therapies for someone with 
diabetes and hypertension “are routine and widely available, if you have 
insurance,” said Dr. Wilper, a medical instructor at the _University of Washington_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/universit
y_of_washington/index.html?inline=nyt-org)  in Seattle. 
The most recent government estimate of the number of people in this country 
without _health insurance_ 
(http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/health_insurance_and_managed_care/index.html?inline=ny
t-classifier)  is 47 million, which means that if the proportions found in 
the study have remained constant, there might be nearly 16 million people in 
this country with a chronic condition but no insurance to pay for medical care. 
Nearly a quarter of the uninsured with a chronic illness who were surveyed 
said they had not visited a health professional within the last year. About 7 
percent said they typically went to a hospital emergency room for care. 
“A lot of people are suffering from a lack of health insurance,” said Dr. 
Steffie Woolhandler, another of the study’s authors, who is a physician and 
associate professor of medicine at Harvard.  
People with high blood pressure, for example, are at risk for catastrophic 
medical events like a stroke if they are not getting the drugs they need or 
having a doctor monitor their disease, said Karen Davis, the president of the 
Commonwealth Fund. The fund, a foundation in New York that specializes in health 
care research, has done its own research into the lack of adequate medical care 
among the uninsured.  
The study, being published Tuesday, may have underestimated exactly how many 
people who are uninsured have a chronic illness, because it includes only 
those who have already received such a diagnosis, the authors said. Individuals 
who have not had their conditions diagnosed because they are not seeing a doctor 
or nurse are not included. 
The study’s authors say that their findings cast doubt on the common 
assumption that many of the uninsured tend to be young and healthy, requiring little 
in the way of medical care. Because so many actually have chronic conditions 
that may be expensive to treat, the cost of covering the uninsured is often 
underestimated, said Dr. Woolhandler, who advocates a nationalized system of 
health care.  
In Massachusetts, she said, the state’s effort to overhaul its health 
insurance system to cover more residents is costing much more than expected and has 
not led to universal coverage because policy makers assumed that more people 
would be healthy. “The state experiments have all failed because of cost,” she 
said.  
The study describes harsh consequences for neglecting easily treatable 
diseases in so many people. “For some of the 11.4 million uninsured Americans with 
serious chronic conditions, access to care seems to be unobtainable; many may 
face early disability and death as a result,” the study’s authors said.

I think everybody has their own version of this,
but in case it's useful.. (only tested on Linux):

find $* \( -type f -o -type l \) -maxdepth 1 -mindepth 1 -print0 |

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

The initrd was built picking up info from /etc/fstab.  You may have to 
make temporary changes to fstab, run yaird to produce a new initrd for 
the partition where you are going to run it (and remember to backout 
changes to fstab).  I have been able to boot a Debian on an USB-HD, it 
was not easy  to set it up.

Commit it if you like but my opinion is that
the modules are different enough that I intend
to keep the vfs_readahead one separate.

Also, to use the current one with defaults
that are exactly tuned to Vista you just use :

vfs objects = readahead

and you get the speedup (on Linux at least,
and that's our major platform). I like that
simplicity and I don't want to lose it.

I know you wrote (and like :-) the cacheprime
module, but that was for a very specific SGI
setup as I recall and I don't think they are
similar enough to merge. They *look* similar
but they're doing different things and it'd
be simpler to leave them that way (IMHO).

Subject:	Presentation to Oman LNG on July 19,2001

Folks,

Please find attached a draft version of the presentation to be made to Oman on July 19-20,2001.  Shubh and I have pieced this presentation together from various lender/Board/Greenfield presentations. A few point before you go on to review the presentation:

You will find that we have delved into more detail on specific issues. This has been done to address queries raised by Oman in their letter dated July 4,2001.

This presentation does not answer queries related to any possible outcome of the present imbroglio and its impact on the OLNG/DPC SPA

We do not propose to give them copies of MSEB's rescission letter as requested by them. While they had earlier asked for a copy of the PTN, we had only summarised the same in an Update to them.

Also please find attached a copy of the letter received from Oman dated July 4,2001 

We have not given any cost estimates on mothballing and cost to complete the project . 

Looking forward to comments from all of you.

fchan <ybmjp@molsci.org>,zqoqi@spamassassin.apache.org,"Tue, 05 Aug 2008 16:11:16 -0800",Re: Getting ? in spam scores.,"Thank you. I have check my DNS and it appears to resolve the link 
correctly. It is just annoying, I think less than 1% of all messages, 
are getting this and I'm checking if there is something I can do to 
solve this.

Another thing is when I do a sa-learn --spam of this message I get 
this message ""Learned tokens from 0 message(s) (1 message(s)

Thank you for your assistance,

The main drivers were increased gross margin due to wholesale sales at a higher price, offset by increased expenses (plant maintenance costs, energy efficiency expenditures, MMF Q1 catch-up, Power Cost Adjustment and GATX leasing portfolio termination fee).

so the pointer loading needs to be optimised to just load the base pointers.

At this point you have probably already swapped the two processes.

I think sa-learn or the process feeding it does not like the chopping.

Don't forget that sa-learn remembers which messages have been learned. Once 
your old messages have all been learned, you need to feed to it only new 
arrivals, that is since the last sa-learn run. No need to keep 180 days worth 
of ham and spam in the temp folder!


Let sa-learn complete and then chop the folder. Just concatenate the process 
rather than schedule it in crontab. It should fix your apparent weirdness.

You're probably right, mine's just the same but with the cream added to the 
eggs.  I guess I should try it without.  Actually looking on the internet for a 
recipe I found this one from possibly one of the scariest people I've ever seen,

hmm.  This still seems to be a test list, which SURBL don't want to see

we'd better leave it out until he wants to see it in.

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

another:

One annoying thing in Unix is when you say something like
open(""/no/such/directory/or/file"",0), it tells you that it something
doesn't exist, but doesn't say what, which sometimes makes for
uninformative error messages.  Now that we have errstr, instead of just
errno, it would be delightful if it would encode something about
what went wrong, so that perror could say something like
	open: failed because directory 'such' does not exist

All things considered, I get that effect with Mailman, but the viable

something called SmartList which is a bitch to set up.

Hi, everyone, 

Tens of thousands draped themselves in Iraqi flags and marched through
the streets of two Shiite holy cities today to mark the fourth
anniversary of Baghdad's fall  to U.S. troops. The show of force was
orchestrated by the radical Shiite cleric Moqtada al Sadr, who proved
that he commands an enormous following among Iraq's largest religious
group. Martin Seemungal is in Baghdad, and will have more on this story
tonight. 

Iran announced a dramatic expansion of uranium enrichment, saying it has
begun operating 3,000 centrifuges. That's nearly 10 times the previously
known number, and is in defiance of U.N. demands that it halt the
program or face increased sanctions. We will have a reality check on the
real threat from Iran. 

President Bush is making another push for immigration reform. He visited
the U.S.-Mexico border to tout a guest worker program for immigrants.
With up to 12 million illegal immigrants in the U.S., lawmakers haven't
agreed on how to uphold the law without disrupting lives, eroding the
work force and risking political upheaval. Kelly Cobiella will report
from the desert stretch where Arizona and Mexico meet. Border agents
there say they are pelted with rocks and the victims of assault from
smugglers. In fact, there have been more assaults against agents in the
Yuma sector this year than all of last year.  

At any one time in this country, as many as 100,000 people are suffering
from heart failure, but only about 2,000 people a year receive heart
transplants. For a long time, doctors were focused on developing a heart
pump as a bridge to when a new heart becomes available.  But a new
device is showing it can be more than just a bridge. Our contributing
medical correspondent, CNN's Sanjay Gupta, will tell you about this. 

There's also a growing uproar over radio host Don Imus' racially charged
comments about the Rutgers University women's basketball team.  Despite
his on-air apologies, the calls continue for him to be fired from his
syndicated morning program, after his racially charged comments. Imus
appeared on the Rev. Al Sharpton's radio program today and issued
another apology. Richard Schlesinger will have this report, and will
discuss the FCC's regulations as well.  

Finally, for computer researcher Zombie Bell even his morning walk to
work is part of a grand experiment in digitizing and remembering
everything. The little camera around his neck takes a picture every 30
seconds or so, and a sound recorder rolls non-stop. Bell is saving his
whole life on computer, from childhood certificates to all his medical
records. John Blackstone will have his story.

 I hope to see you tonight.

Subject: CSFB Independent Power Weekly-Issue #35


Good Morning,

Attached, please find the latest issue of our Independent Power Weekly.

 <<IPW071601.pdf>>  <<CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference.pdf>> 
Summary:
1. IPPs Fall 1.9%   Last week our IPP composite fell 1.9%, underperforming
both the NASDAQ (+4.0%) and the S&P 500 (+2.1%).  Calpine was the strongest
performer in the group, rising 4.5%.  AES was the weakest performer, falling
9.5%.  

2. 4 Items to Focus On   In our view, there were four items worth focusing
on from last week: 1.) AES fell 10% owing to Latin American concerns.  We
see downside to our 2001 estimate; 2.) The FERC settlement conference
adjourned on July 9.  On July 12, the presiding ALJ issued a recommendation
favorable to generators; 3.) On July 12, the US bankruptcy court approved
Calpine's settlement with PG&E; and, 4.) On July 10, NRG Energy announced it
would acquire a 2,255 MW portfolio from Indeck.

3. Latin America Pressuring AES Earnings   The likelihood of downside to our
2001 EPS estimate for AES. Corp. of $1.89 has increased materially.  We
believe the ongoing currency weakness combined with power rationing have the
potential to negatively impact 2001 EPS by $0.25-$0.30 versus prior
expectations-on a stand-alone basis.  While management indicated in mid-May
that it could offset weakness in Brazil, the currency has materially
depreciated since that time and shows no signs of improvement in the
near-term.  AES's second quarter earnings conference call will take place on
July 26.  Following the call, we will adjust our 2001 estimate accordingly,
unless management indicates that it remains positioned to offset these items
through upside in other parts of its business.

4.  FERC ALJ Issues Report    On Thursday (7/12), Curtis Wagner, the
Administrative Law Judge who presided over the recent settlement conference,
issued a report presenting his findings and recommendations for next steps.
Overall, the report was very much consistent with our expectations.  While
Wagner notes that some refunds are due from the generators, he argues that
the $8.9 billion demanded by the State of California ""cannot be
substantiated.""   We believe Calpine and Mirant offer the greatest downside
protection from this issue.  

5. CSFB Power Generation Supply Chain Conference   On September 10 and 11,
CSFB will host a Power Generation Supply Chain Conference at the Plaza Hotel
in New York City.  This event is designed to provide investors with a
wholistic perspective on all aspects of the sector-from coal and natural gas
companies, to equipment and construction service providers, to the power
producers themselves.  Please contact us if you would like additional
information.

Times of India, Editorial, 5th April, 2007
Intellectual propriety
Anuradha Rajivan
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/OPINION/Editorial/Intellectual_propriety/articleshow/msid-1858184,curpg-1.cms


As efforts are underway to revive World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks to bring the Doha Round to its logical conclusion there is an urgent need to take a fresh look at intellectual property rights (IPRs).

The debate has been driven largely by commercial interests. Public interest is equally, if not more, important. We need to understand that different situations may require different solutions balancing commercial interests with the public good.

Global institutions like World Intellectual Property Organisation that specialise in intellectual property, together with the WTO agreement on Trade Related aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) are increasingly influencing the governance of intellectual work.

Should intellectual work be subordinated to human well-being or to profit? Are the two necessarily contradictory? Is it logical to take different positions for different types of intellectual outputs?

While the argument for property rights favours financial gain as the best incentive, the contrary view is that strong IPRs inhibit innovation and development of new technologies with implications for biodiversity and concerns for the poor making medicines more expensive or farmers' seeds ineffective.

IPR issues are often seen as developed versus developing country positions the former with strong aggressive interests and the latter with more defensive interests. The balance of power is in favour of industrial lobbies in developed countries that have successfully increased the breadth and coverage of IPRs from trade secrets, utility models, and broadcasting rights to rights on data compilation.

However, the positions can well be reversed as in the case of traditional knowledge. IPRs do not have to be all or nothing. It is possible to take differing positions depending on the 'public good' nature of the product. The challenge lies in finding ways to balance rewards to the innovator while facilitating wider access and dissemination to spur further innovation and newer applications.

For instance, biotechnologies are at the cutting edge - in the laboratory and commercially. The original species for this research comes mainly from tropical countries rich in biodiversity. Corporations patent these resources after getting them from poor communities.

The US patent on turmeric for healing wounds is an example. While most corporations in the business see it as bio-prospecting, and demand strong IPRs, for poor communities this is bio-piracy as they lose out on fees worth millions of dollars for prospecting rights.

Adding value to traditional knowledge through geographical indications (GIs), is an excellent opportunity for developing countries to aggressively leverage commercial gains from IP. A GI identifies a good as originating in a specific region, with quality or characteristics attribu-table to its geographic origin.

Most GIs are used for relative luxuries like wine, spirits and cheese. Traditional knowledge can push the use of GI beyond luxury goods and whole communities can benefit. Examples are basmati rice of India and Pakistan, tea from Sri Lanka, Phu Quoc fish sauce and Hunza apricots. Another idea not yet utilised is GI in services like Thai massages and Asian hospitality.

A major area of concern is the implication for drug prices with the strengthening of IPRs in pharma-ceuticals. The cost of essential drugs is much lower in India than in neighbouring Pakistan - with different intellectual property regimes.

India has historically had 'process' patents, not 'product' patents, allowing domestic pharmaceutical companies to produce low-priced copies of patented drugs. This simple provision in the original Indian Patents Act (1970) increased competition and put pressure on pharma-ceutical companies to keep prices low.

India is the fourth largest producer of pharmaceuticals and a large supplier of low-cost generic drugs to other developing countries. As a signatory to the TRIPS agreement India was under pressure to modify its IP laws, to change to a 'product' patents regime. A 2004 amendment to the Indian Patents Act made the country WTO compliant but this was later reversed under intense domestic pressure.

Arts and entertainment is one area where the argument of public good for human well-being need not be an issue. Music, painting and film are the works of specific artists who should be compensated for the use of their work. Strong IPRs in these areas is less likely to compromise social good.

""GARRETT"" CONTROLS STATE WORKER'S SUIT CHARGING VIOLATION OF
TITLE V OF ADA

Sovereign immunity bars a former California state senate
committee staffer's federal lawsuit alleging he was fired in
violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act after
telling a state senator that the committee's refusal to hire
a disabled campaign worker violated federal law, the Ninth
Circuit rules (""Demshki v. Monteith,  ""9th Cir.,  No.
00-15599,  7/2/01).

Reversing a trial court's refusal to throw out David
Demshki's claim against the California Senate Rules
Committee, Judge G. Silverman finds that the U.S. Supreme
Court's recent holding in ""Board of Trustees of the
University of Alabama v. Garrett, "" which found unconsenting
states immune from suits brought under Title I of the
ADA--prohibiting disability-based employment
discrimination--also is applicable to cases brought under
Title V of the act. Title V prohibits discrimination against
those who oppose discriminatory acts or practices made
illegal by the ADA. . . . Page AA-1

RETIREMENT PLAN WITH LOWER HEALTH BENEFITS DID NOT VIOLATE
ADEA

A voluntary retirement plan initiated as a cost-savings
measure by the University of Rhode Island did not violate
the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, even though it
provided a lower health insurance stipend for participants
over the age of 65 when they became eligible for Medicare
coverage, a federal judge rules (""Gutchen v. Board of
Governors of Univ. of Rhode Island, ""D.R.I., No. 99-319,
6/22/01).

""In short, the health benefit stipend component of the
voluntary retirement incentive plan complies with the ADEA,""
Judge Lagueux of the U.S. District Court for the District of
Rhode Island writes. ""The ADEA ensures equal, not
preferential treatment for older employees. There is no
violation of the ADEA when the employer provides the same
level of benefits to older workers as to younger workers.""

He grants summary judgment to the university and rejects the
claims of two professors, whose challenge to the plan was
supported by the AARP Foundation Litigation, the nonprofit
legal advocacy arm of AARP, the senior citizens'
organization. . . . Page A-6

BEST BUY AGREES TO PAY $5.4 MILLION TO SETTLE OVERTIME
DISPUTE

Best Buy Inc., the national chain of electronic products
stores, has agreed to pay $5.4 million to settle a dispute
regarding its payment of overtime to employees, the Labor
Department announces. The Minneapolis-based firm was charged
with not properly compensating some 70,000 current and
former workers as required by the Fair Labor Standards Act.
According to DOL, workers were not paid for hours worked on
their days off, time worked during meal breaks, hours worked
after they punched out on the time clock, and time they
waited for managers to unlock doors at the end of shifts.
Best Buy also did not keep an accurate record of hours
worked by employees as required by the FLSA, the Labor
Department says.

Best Buy ""disputes the Labor Department's findings, but
decided to resolve the case to avoid protracted litigation,""
a company spokeswoman says. The company expects that
""qualified employees will receive a letter and checks in
approximately six to 10 weeks,"" she says. Best Buy has
""agreed to comply with the federal overtime pay law in the
future and cooperated fully during the investigation,"" says
Denise Scharlemann, director of DOL's Wage and Hour Division
in Minneapolis. The nationwide agreement covers employees of
the company's 400 stores who worked from February 1998 to
February 2000. . . . Page A-1

ASARCO, FOUR UNIONS REACH AGREEMENT TO COVER 1,450 COPPER
WORKERS

 Asarco Inc. and four unions reach a tentative agreement on
new three-year contracts to cover some 1,450 employees at
the company's Southwest copper mining and refinery
operations. Union members are voting on the proposal and a
tally of votes is expected to be completed July 5.

The proposal calls for two wage increases and some
improvements in benefits. The first increase of 50 cents per
hour would occur when the price of copper reaches $1 a pound
or on July 1, 2002, whichever occurs first. The second wage
increase, also 50 cents per hour, would become effective
July 1, 2003.  A union representative says the price of
copper is currently in the 70-cent per-pound range. The four
unions that are party to the agreement are the United
Steelworkers, the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, and the
Operating Engineers. . . . Page A-1

NO NEED FOR LAYOFF NOTICE IN WISCONSIN IF BUSINESS CONTINUES
DESPITE SALE

A company that sold its business assets to another firm that
continued operations without interruption was not required
under Wisconsin law to provide employees 60 days' advance
notice of a permanent or temporary shutdown, the state
supreme court rules ("" Wisconsin v. T.J. Int'l Inc., ""Wis.,
No. 99-2803, 6/28/01). Norco Windows Inc. did not violate
Wisconsin's business closing law when it sold its window
manufacturing plant to Jeld-Wen Inc., which continued to
operate the company without interruption, the court says.
The court's decision overrules the state workforce
development agency's determination that the law covered the
company's sale and that both the seller and buyer should be
penalized for failing to give advance notice to the 47 Norco
employees Jeld-Wen failed to hire.

The Wisconsin Business Closing and Mass Layoff Law's
definition of ""business closing"" does not include ""the sale
of business assets where there is no actual operational
shutdown--permanent or temporary--of the employment site,""
the court says. ""Where, as here, the transfer of ownership
continues rather than interrupts or ceases the operation of
the employment site, there is no 'business closing' under
the statute, and no 60-day notice of the sale is required,""
according to the court. . . . Page A-7

Dear Jane
We have previously advised Enron on the handling of customer data.
The Japanese Diet is now considering a bill for the protection of private data
that will bring in new rules and obligations for credit providers and others
handling private information. Under the bill, a person handling private data may
only use the data within the scope of the purpose disclosed to the individual
from whom the data was obtained. The bill also provides that the purpose must be
within reasonable limits and that private data may not be disclosed to a third
party without the prior consent of the individual from whom the information was
obtained.

Worst-case scenario is loss of personal data, and/or
run-away process which consumes resources (memory or
disk space if not constrained by ulimit or quota) until
there's a system crash.

What you WON'T have to do is reinstall the whole system.

You see...the whole Unix security model PRESUMED that
a user might (either unintentionally or intentionally)
write and/or execute a run-away process which could
be destructive.  Write-permissions (or lack of them)
prevent the process from doing damage to anything other
than the user's own personal files.

Oh god, I think the earth moved for me.
I am drumming up support for plan 9 here, but when I say it
doesn't run emacs, people lose all interest and the weird thing
is that after about 2 weeks of running sam, I would hate to go
back to emacs, and I am a die hard emacs/vi fan.  But most people
don't seem to be willing to take the time to learn sam properly.
People I showed sam to... oh whats the point.

The compatibility list seems to be working, I got some mail about
it, so people, if you have PC's running plan 9, mail me your
configuration/hardware specs and get them incorporated into the
list.

Newspaper's readers complain over 'let's have sex' picture caption

Readers of an African newspaper have complained after a picture caption
about jewellery contained the words ""let's have sex"".
The mix-up highlights the problems caused by the wide range of languages
spoken in Namibia.
Callers to the Namibian were angered by the use of the word tulumweni, which
translates roughly as ""let's have intercourse"" in the Oshiwambo language.
It was used in a caption concerning people in the Caprivi who use rings from
the femidon - female condom - as jewellery.
According to the The Namibian , an activist involved in care for Aids/HIV
patients spelt the word tulumweni for the journalist.
He intended it to mean ""you will see for yourselves"" in the Siyeyi tongue.
One caller said the complainants ""should be considerate of other people's
languages. It is very clear that the picture was taken in the Caprivi ...And
that the word is from Siyeyi. It is not Oshiwambo"".
Others indicated that various words might have different meanings in various
Namibian languages, such as omakende, an Oshiwambo word for glasses which in
Siyeyi means testicles.
Another word with a double-meaning is tulikunde, which in Oshiwambo
translates as let's talk, but which in Sisubiya translates as let's have
intercourse.
The Herero word for a hat is ekoli, which is an Oshiwambo word for a vagina.

IMHO, one of the nice things about plan 9 is how easily

Yes, confirmed, but for my part, I'm using mostly non-antialiased fonts
and 
they are true ugly without the bytecode interpreter enabled.

Remember my stupid request about your RPM ;-)

OK, so you want a Greek character and not a Greek symbol.  As I said they 
are different (different fonts, different shapes aka glyphs).

a <- ""A)""
b <- ""stbA::cat""
paste(a, ""\\u0394"", b)

(Number from http://www.alanwood.net/unicode/greek.html .)  This should 
work in a UTF-8 locale and also on Windows (in a windows() device or in 
the Rgui console).

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

What happened to more highly-capitalized
land?  Putting in trees instead of crops
sounds like it might sidestep that.

On the ""to find"" list.  Any chance of
an explanation of that ""Bell Jar"" in
the meantime?

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT 
listers were approached by him (via email) - a little research in 
dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly 
hoping to contact girls, appearing in ""alt.teens"" and similar groups -
 I just tried a Google Groups search on ""Robert Moaby"" and some of 
them came top of the list.

Note for Marie - ""MT"" stands for Mark Thomas, a slightly slimmer, UK 
version of your Michael Moore - the mailing list is named after him.

PG&E Gas Transmission-Northwest (GTN) said it received market requests for about three times the capacity on a proposed lateral that would cross Washington and compete with Northwest Pipeline for rapidly expanding power generation markets in the western half of the state along the I-5 highway corridor. GTN closed its open season for the Washington Lateral Project June 22. It was the third open season for a GTN pipeline expansion this year. Meanwhile Northwest Pipeline has four expansions of its own planned for the region. 
""The level of customer interest we received demonstrates the increasing demand for gas in Washington State,"" said Peter Lund, vice president of the PG&E National Energy Group, which includes GTN. Lund said GTN envisions a pipeline capable of transporting 300,000 to 400,000 Dth/d of gas. GTN said it received expressions of interest from local distributors and power generators. 
The lateral would begin at GTN south of Spokane and head west to the Mid-Columbia area in central Washington, across the Cascades to the I-5 corridor in western Washington, which is served currently by only Northwest Pipeline. The ultimate route for the project has not been determined, and exact delivery points will be determined as the pipeline works out agreements with customers, the company said. ""I want you to know that Mount Rainier is in the middle of the route area we are looking at but we will not be going over Mount Rainier because it's a national park; there's no way we are going to do that,"" said a GTN spokeswoman. ""We're basically going to go from east to west over the mountains to I-5."" 
The pipeline companies in the Pacific Northwest have worked themselves into an expansion frenzy with two large mainline expansions and this new state-crossing lateral planned by GTN and four large laterals, including a new line to Vancouver Island, planned by Williams' Northwest Pipeline.  The power crisis has been the primary driver. Up until the last few decades, the region has relied on hydroelectricity and wood for its power generation, but now it is turning to natural gas.

Ok, Forsyth has this exact setup up and running.  I can send out the
war story of his if you want.

Re: Market. I am not sure if going commercial with plan 9 will change
anything any more.  I wish it would, for then I would not have to
program or manage MS-Windows/X11 et al. when I go out to work.
The fact that I am paying for college by adminstrating large unix
boxen is annoying enough as it is.

Plan 9 is very nice but I am not sure if it can make it commercially.
MS-Windows: the stuff nightmares are made up out of.

Rebranding: taking something and changing nothing about it except its name. 
In the UK Marathon bars became Snickers bar, Jif cleaning fluid became Cif 
and Talking Stick became Secret Chiefs, y'know?

Colin Nevin <colin.nevin@meritsolutions.ie>,ilug@linux.ie,08 Oct 2002 17:34:37 +0000,[ILUG] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!),"Hi All,

Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.

The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.

Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?

Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

... which is most of the defaults.

USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)

But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.

btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

Colin.
